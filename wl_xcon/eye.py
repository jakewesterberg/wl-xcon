"""Gaze ingest: OpenIrisDPI's UDP protocol, parsed and made stale-aware.

**Protocol verified 2026-09-01** against the client that ships in the OpenIrisDPI
repository (`PythonUDP/openiris_udp_client.py`): send the literal string
`WAITFORDATA` to UDP port 9003 and receive a JSON object with `Left` and `Right`,
each carrying `FrameNumber`, `Pupil.Center.{X,Y}`, `Pupil.Size.{Width,Height}` and a
`CRs` list whose index 0 is the first Purkinje image and index 3 the fourth.

Three things this module exists to get right, none of which is parsing:

**The gaze signal is P1 minus P4.** Both Purkinje images move with the eye and with
the camera relative to the head, so either alone confounds rotation with translation.
Their difference cancels translation to first order, which is the whole of what buys
DPI its arcminute precision. Using the pupil centre would throw that away while still
producing entirely plausible numbers.

**Timestamps are local.** The protocol is poll-based and carries no clock we can
trust, so a sample is stamped when it arrives here. Offline reconstruction against
the camera's shared sync line stays the timing ground truth (S3); this is for the
trial loop, which needs to know how old its information is, not what time it is.

**Staleness has a ceiling and a floor.** P6: ~2% of OpenIrisDPI frames take >= 10 ms,
worst measured ~50 ms. A tracker reporting loss on the first late frame reports loss
constantly; one that never reports it hands the loop a position the eye left long ago.

**UNVERIFIED:** what OpenIris emits when tracking fails on one eye -- zeros, a null,
or an absent key -- is not documented in the material read, and guessing would put a
fabricated validity rule in the one place that decides whether an animal is looking.
`parse` therefore treats a structurally incomplete eye as no sample at all, and the
real failure representation is a bench measurement (V3) before this runs on an animal.
