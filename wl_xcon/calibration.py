"""Gaze calibration: the raw Purkinje vector to degrees, per eye.

**The model is not ours.** `wl-preproc/wl_preproc/eye/calibration.py` fixed it before
this file existed -- `AFFINE` is `[1, dx, dy]`, `SECOND_ORDER` is
`[1, dx, dy, dx², dy², dx·dy]`, taken from OpenIrisDPI's own tutorial notebook -- and
`wl_preproc/eye/xcon.py` fixed the file we write it into. We supply the
*procedure*: which targets to present, how to refuse a constellation that cannot
carry the model, and how to serialise the result. Read their source before changing
anything here; their README does not describe it (CLAUDE.md, trap 1).

**We do not import theirs.** `wl-preproc` pulls DataJoint, Kilosort and SpikeInterface
behind it, none of which belongs on a task PC -- the same reasoning `tests/conftest.py`
records for the event codec. So `basis` and `conditioning` are reimplemented here and
`tests/test_calibration.py` proves them equal to theirs, function by function, over
random constellations. What we never write is a *reader*: reading the file back is
their side of the contract and a second reader would be a second definition.

**Fitting allocates; applying does not.** `fit_eye` runs at a block boundary and uses
numpy freely. `EyeMap.degrees` runs on every gaze sample inside the trial loop, so it
is six multiplies and five adds on plain floats, with no array, no allocation and no
branch on model beyond a stored length (CLAUDE.md, hot-path discipline).

**Three refusals, and the order matters.** Point count is checked *before*
conditioning, because conditioning is structurally blind to under-determination:
their `fit_map` docstring records four spread targets against a six-term basis
scoring a healthy 0.2787 while the design is 4x6 and two dimensions are simply
missing. Conditioning is checked before the fit, so a degenerate constellation is a
named finding rather than a singular matrix. And extent is reported after both,
because it is the one thing conditioning *cannot* see -- being scale-invariant by
design -- and it is the difference between a calibration that is honest about its own
error and one that understates it. See
`docs/measurements/dev-machine/2026-09-05-calibration-constellation.md`.
