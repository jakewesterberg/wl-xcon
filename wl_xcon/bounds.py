"""The bounded config: what a task cannot express and a console cannot exceed.

**Welfare-critical. Human review required before merge** (CLAUDE.md, S8 §7). Pure:
the limits, and the arithmetic of whether a number is past one or short of it. No
clock, no hardware, no state outliving a question -- `welfare.py` has all three.

**S8 §5.2b, §5.2c and §5.2d carry the arguments.** §5.2d indexes every refusal in
this file and in `welfare.py` to the failure it was written against, so "is this one
earned?" is a lookup.

- **Fluid has a floor, not a ceiling** (PI, 2026-09-06). The daily figure is a
  minimum topped up by hand after the session, so nothing here caps earned reward and
  no delivery is refused on volume. This file was built the other way round until
  then, and refused deliveries an animal had earned.
- **`Ceiling` and `Floor` are different types**, because they were the same one when
  the daily figure came to be compared with `>`. A `Floor` cannot be passed to `set`;
  a `Ceiling` cannot be asked for a shortfall.
- **A task cannot name a magnitude at all**: `Reward` takes the name of an entry here
  and the type refuses a number (S1 §2.3), so the guardrail is what a task can
  *express* rather than what review notices -- which matters because the task was
  probably written by a model (P15).
- **A console may move a value within its ceiling and not past it**, and **checking
  and moving are two calls** (`validate`, then `set`) because they happen at two
  moments -- see `validate`.
- **An unknown daily total leaves the shortfall unknown** rather than answering zero.
  Not a refusal to deliver, a refusal to *claim*.
