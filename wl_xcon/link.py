"""The telemetry message a running session publishes to its consoles, and its schema.

S9a §6-§10 designs the console; **§9, "The telemetry contract," is what this file
implements.** This file holds the message (`Telemetry`, `Staged`, `Refused`), the
idle frame `wlx taskd` publishes while no session is open (`Idle`, since schema 10;
carrying the last closed session's summary since schema 11),
the commands a console sends back (`SetParameter`, `Stop`, and since b3a the service's
`OpenSession`, `CheckRun`, `StartRun` and `EndSession`, and since XC-026 its
`ResumeSession`; `Command`), the port a session
publishes and drains through (`Link`, `Absent`, `Simulated`), its wire encoding
(`encode`/`decode`, plus the command-side `_encode_command`/`_decode_command`), and
the one live transport that carries all of it over a real socket (`ZmqLink`,
`ZmqConsole`). Nothing here is deferred to a later module -- an earlier version of
this docstring said `encode`/`decode` would land "in a transport module", but Task 5's
own brief puts them in this file instead, so that plan changed and this file is now
current with the code rather than pointing at a module that does not exist.

**Not welfare-critical, and it must not become one.** CLAUDE.md requires human review
before merge for welfare-critical code; `docs/design/architecture.md` names
`wl_xcon/bounds.py` and `wl_xcon/welfare.py` as the two such
modules, "and nothing else." This file carries no ceiling, no clock and no pump, and
is deliberately not a third. It reads
`welfare`; it never decides anything on its own about what `welfare` reports -- a
limit enforced twice, once in `welfare` and once in a console message, is a limit that
can disagree with itself.

**S9a §9's one rule: every number on the console comes from the object the record is
written from, never computed beside it.** `Telemetry.of` reads `session.welfare`,
`tally` and `scheduler` and assembles the message; it recomputes nothing. A console
showing a sum of reward commands instead of `welfare.session_total()` would silently
disagree with the record the moment `welfare` had a bug in it -- a second,
usually-agreeing implementation is exactly how that bug would hide instead of showing
up on screen.

**Unknown is `None`, never `0`.** `fluid_today_ml` and `shortfall_ml` follow
`welfare.shortfall()`'s own refusal to claim an unmeasured day went well. A console
that rendered `0.0` for a day nobody measured would be a confident answer to a
question nobody could actually answer.

#: Bumped whenever a field changes meaning or disappears. ADR-0003: "schema-versioned
#: messages ... version field from day one". A console reading an older schema than it
#: knows must say so rather than render a field it has guessed the meaning of.
#:
#: 2 (2026-09-19): `refusals` stopped meaning "every refusal since the session
#: started" and became "the most recent `REFUSAL_HISTORY`", and `refusals_dropped`
#: was added to say how many are missing. That is a field changing meaning, which is
#: exactly what this number exists for.
#:
#: 3 (2026-09-19, PI): `Staged.bounded` stopped meaning "this value is already live"
#: and became "this name is checked against a welfare ceiling rather than the task's
#: `Param`". No field was added or removed, which is why this one matters: a console
#: built against schema 2 renders a `bounded=True` row as ALREADY IN EFFECT, and
#: would now tell an operator who has just *lowered* a reward volume that it has
#: taken effect while one more trial is still to go out at the old one. A field that
#: still decodes and no longer means what it did is the case this number exists for.
#:
#: 4 (2026-09-19, PI): `chair_seconds` stopped being the number that ends the
#: session and became a recorded quantity beside it; `out_of_cage_seconds` is the
#: one the ceiling is now read against, and is `None` for a cage-side session that
#: declared it has no duration bound at all. A console built against schema 3 shows
#: chair time as *the* clock and would watch a session stop on a limit it never
#: displayed -- the same "a field still decodes and no longer means what it did"
#: case as 3, with a welfare limit on the other end of it.
#:
#: 5 (2026-09-20, PI): head-fixation stopped being a blanket rig requirement, so
#: there are three deployment kinds rather than two. `chair_seconds` became
#: `float | None` -- **absent, never `0.00`, for the two kinds that take no
#: head-fixation marks** -- `deployment` was added so a console can say *which*
#: absence it is looking at rather than deriving it, and `duration_warning` was added
#: for the warning that now precedes the out-of-cage limit. A console built against 4
#: renders `chair_seconds` with a `None` in it, and one that coerced would tell an
#: operator a restrained animal had been restrained for no time at all.
#:
#: 6 (2026-09-26, P4d-2a): `phase`, `stop_kind`, and -- added later in the same
#: slice, while schema 6 was still unreleased (Task 9) -- `in_session_seconds`, the
#: PI's second clock, apart from out-of-cage and bounding nothing. A console built
#: against 5 renders an awaiting-return frame's advancing clock as a running
#: session, and has no field at all for the in-session one.
#:
#: 7 (2026-09-26, P4d-2b b1): the configuration a session runs under (`task`,
#: `allocation`, `bounds_config`, `params`), the two limits its numbers are read
#: against (`floor_ml`, `out_of_cage_limit_s`), the frame's own instant (`wall_at`,
#: ledger Ruling 1, 2026-09-27), `last_reward_at` and `recent_outcomes`. Nothing
#: changed meaning. A reader built against 6 decodes a
#: schema-7 frame and ignores the additions; a schema-7 reader cannot decode a
#: schema-6 frame, which lacks them, and `wlx serve` says so on its page rather than
#: showing a guess (`serve.Server._listen`).
#:
#: 8 (2026-09-27, P4d-2b b2a): the controls from the box -- `paused_at` (whether the
#: session is paused, and since when), `scheduled_stop` (kind, target, who, and its
#: words), and `controls` with `controls_dropped` (the recent control events a
#: changes feed lists). Nothing changed meaning. A schema-7 reader refuses a schema-8
#: frame, and a schema-8 reader a schema-7 one, by name (`SchemaMismatch`), as §3's
#: schema rule says.
#:
#: 9 (2026-09-29, direct view part 2): `view`, the setup the session runs in, and
#: `half_ipd_cm`, the animal's half-IPD its stereoscope field was built for (`None` in
#: direct view). Nothing changed meaning. A schema-8 reader refuses a schema-9 frame,
#: and a schema-9 reader a schema-8 one, by name (`SchemaMismatch`).
#:
#: 10 (2026-09-29, P4d-2b b3a): sessions of several runs, and a service between them.
#: `phase` gains `between_runs`; `run_index` names the run (`None` before any);
#: `block` and `task` are `None` before a session's first run; `preflight` is the run
#: about to start's; `question` a far mark a console owes an answer on; `service` says a
#: frame came from `wlx taskd`, whose stream a run's stop does not end; `offered_tasks`
#: what it offers. **And a second shape, `Idle`**, published while no session is open
#: (phase `idle`). Nothing else changed meaning. A reader of 9 refuses 10 and 10 refuses
#: 9, by name, before any other field -- for both shapes (`SchemaMismatch`).
#:
#: 11 (2026-09-30, the b3a-2 final review, I2): `Idle.closed`, the last closed session's
#: final `Telemetry` -- its supplement owed among it -- carried until the next session
#: opens, since `wlx taskd` closes a session and publishes idle frames in one pass and
#: spec §6.2 has the page show the closed session's summary. `None` before any session
#: has closed and once the next opens. Nothing else changed meaning. A reader of 10
#: refuses 11 and 11 refuses 10, by name (`SchemaMismatch`).
#:
#: 12 (2026-10-01, session-levels spec §5): `performance`, the strip's session, task,
#: run and block counts from `taskd.Session.performance`, and `returned_at`, the
#: recorded return (`welfare.returned_wall_at`). `outcomes` and `trial_index` stay the
#: run's, unchanged in meaning. A reader of 11 refuses 12 and 12 refuses 11, by name.
#:
#: 13 (2026-10-01, XC-026): `Stranded.resumable` and `why`, whether a stranded session
#: can be resumed and why not; `Telemetry.resumed_at`, the instant a session was resumed
#: (`None` for one opened in this process). Nothing else changed meaning. A reader of 12
#: refuses 13 and 13 refuses 12, by name.
#:
#: 14 (2026-10-02, P4d-2b b2b spec §6): every `by` is an actor's map, a box name or a
#: wl.works member (`actor.to_map`), where it was a string; a refusal's and a control's
#: is null for nobody, where it was `"<unknown>"` or empty. A reader of 13 refuses 14 and
#: 14 refuses 13, by name.
#:
#: 15 (2026-10-08, engine build B): `Telemetry.session_kind`, what the session is for;
#: `Telemetry.calibration`, the color calibration's id, or `None` while the rig's record will
#: not load; `Telemetry.warnings`, the warnings the session accepted, each a `WarningRow`
#: with who accepted it and when; and `Idle.warnings`, those an open will ask to accept,
#: unaccepted. A row's code and sentence are cut to `TEXT_LIMIT` and `NOTE_LIMIT` characters
#: (`WarningRow.of`). A reader of 14 refuses 15 and 15 refuses 14, by name, for both shapes.
SCHEMA = 15

#: How many refusals a session keeps, per source, and therefore how many one
#: `Telemetry` frame can carry.
#:
#: **This is a bound on work an untrusted peer can cause, not a display preference.**
#: `Telemetry.refusals` was cumulative and uncapped, and `Telemetry.of` re-encodes the
#: whole of it at every trial boundary. The party that drives its growth is not the
#: operator: `ZmqLink.drain` appends one `Refused` per wire packet it cannot decode,
#: and any peer that can reach the REP socket can send those as fast as it likes. A
#: console built against a bumped `SCHEMA` does it by accident, every packet, forever
#: -- which is the realistic case, not an attack. Both the per-boundary encode and the
#: published PUB frame then grow linearly and without limit.
#:
#: 50, because the number has to clear what a person can plausibly do and stay far
#: under what a loop can. A refusal is a human act at heart -- a mistyped parameter
#: name, a volume above its ceiling -- and fifty of them in one session is already far
#: past the point where somebody would stop and look at the screen; the console shows
#: a handful of lines, so nothing an operator needs is among the ones dropped. At the
#: same time it keeps the frame small: measured on this branch (scratchpad probe, not
#: committed under `docs/measurements/` and not a claim about this system's latency,
#: jitter or throughput -- it is a byte count), one frame carrying the longest refusal
#: this code can produce is 231 bytes empty, 5,433 bytes at 50, 104,233 bytes at 1,000
#: and 1,040,233 bytes at 10,000, re-encoded every boundary.
#:
#: Nothing is lost silently: what falls off is counted in `Telemetry.refusals_dropped`
#: and `ZmqLink.refused_dropped`, and `cli.render` prints the count.
REFUSAL_HISTORY = 50

#: How many recent outcomes a `Telemetry` frame carries, oldest first: the browser
#: console's Runtime ticks (P4d-2b spec §4.1, "the last 60"). Capped for
#: `REFUSAL_HISTORY`'s reason -- a frame is re-encoded at every trial boundary -- and a
#: display bound, not a measurement.
RECENT_OUTCOMES = 60

#: How many recent control events -- a pause, a resume, a mark and its note, a
#: schedule, a cancellation, an applied setting -- a session keeps for its consoles'
#: changes feed, newest kept (P4d-2b spec §5.1). A display bound, capped for
#: `REFUSAL_HISTORY`'s reason; what falls off is counted in `Session.controls_dropped`
#: and the session record keeps every one (`record.CONTROLS`).

    **Published to every console, not only to whoever staged it** (S9a §8). With no

    at the next trial boundary is that everybody can see it queued.

    **Every row is genuinely pending, whatever `bounded` says** (PI, 2026-09-19).
    `Session._apply_staged` applies all of them at the top of the next pass, and the

        `session`, `tally` and `scheduler` are deliberately untyped. Later in this
        slice, `taskd.Session` holds a `Link` and `taskd.py` imports this module -- so
        a `Session` type hint on the first parameter would import `taskd`, which would
        import `link`, immediately. `tally` (`simulate.Tally`) and `scheduler`
        (`scheduler.Scheduler`) are left the same way for symmetry rather than
        annotating two parameters and not the third. Do not add these hints to
        satisfy a linter; the cycle is real.

        **`session.link.refused` is read as a plain attribute, on purpose.** Both
        steps used to be `getattr(..., default)`: the outer one so that

        stand-in carries a real `Absent()`. An absent link is an `AttributeError`
        here, which is the point.

    plain dicts happily enough for encoding, but `decode` still has to rebuild
    `Staged`/`Refused` instances to make `restored == original` true, so the two

def _release(ctx, sockets) -> None:
    """Close each of `sockets` with `linger=0`, then terminate `ctx`.

    This is how a `ZmqLink` or a `ZmqConsole` lets go of ZeroMQ, and it is the only
    way. Each object registers it with `weakref.finalize` before opening its first
    socket, and passes the context and its own list of sockets, which the constructor
    appends to as each one opens. It is reached four ways:

    - `close()` calls it directly, and detaches the finalizer only once it returns,
      so a release interrupted partway leaves the net armed (`ZmqLink.close`).
    - `ZmqLink.__init__` calls `close()` when its binds raise partway. Only
      `ZmqLink`'s constructor does: `ZmqConsole.__init__` has no `except`, and a
      half-built console is released by its finalizer when it is freed.
    - The finalizer runs it, at most once, when an object is freed without `close()`
      having run: by reference counting, the usual case, or by the cyclic collector,
      when the object is in a reference cycle.
    - `weakref.finalize`'s exit hook runs a finalizer still alive at interpreter exit.

    It is idempotent. A closed socket is skipped, and `destroy` returns at once on a
    closed context, so running it again after a completed or interrupted release does
    no harm. Nothing here runs per frame.

    **Why it holds the sockets itself (Ruling 18, 2026-09-27).** The net used to be
    `weakref.finalize(self, self._ctx.destroy, 0)`, and when the cyclic collector freed
    an unclosed object, that net deadlocked the collecting thread:

    - pyzmq's `Context.destroy` closes the sockets it finds in `Context._sockets`, a
      `WeakSet`, then calls `term()`. `term()` blocks until every socket in the context
      is closed.
    - The collector clears every weak reference to the objects it is about to free
      before it invokes any weakref callback. So by the time the finalizer ran, the
      sockets were already gone from that set. `destroy` closed nothing, and `term()`
      waited for two sockets that were still open.
    - Each socket's `Socket.__del__` would have closed it, but the collector runs
      `__del__` only after the callbacks return, on the same thread. So `term()` never
      returned.

    Measured: freed by reference counting, the old finalizer's `destroy` found 2 live
    sockets, and the process went on. Freed through a cycle, it found 0, and the
    process hung in `term` <- `destroy` <- `weakref.__call__`. That happened in a bare
    script with no pytest, and in this suite. The `*_released_by_the_collector*` tests
    in `tests/test_link.py` are that reproduction. The cycle is real: `taskd.Session`
    holds its `Rig`, the `Rig`'s `wall_clock` is a method bound to that session, and a
    `wlx run --link` session holds its `ZmqLink`. Every production construction uses
    `with`, so `close()` runs. But the net exists for the case where it did not, and
    in that case it hung the trial process.

    Sources: pyzmq 27.2.0, as installed in this repo's venv, read 2026-09-27.
    `zmq/sugar/context.py` has `Context.destroy`, which iterates `_sockets`, then
    `term()`, and its docstring's thread warning. `zmq/sugar/socket.py` has
    `Socket.__del__`, which calls `close()` if the socket is not closed.
    `zmq/backend/cython/_zmq.py` has `Context._term`, which calls `zmq_ctx_destroy`
    with the GIL released and does nothing on a closed context, and `Socket.close`,
    which does nothing on a closed socket. The collector's order is CPython 3.12.13's
    `Modules/gcmodule.c`: `handle_weakrefs` clears, then calls back, and
    `gc_collect_main` runs `finalize_garbage` after it. Read 2026-09-27.

    **What changed.** The finalizer's arguments are the context and the list of
    sockets. Never the object, and never a bound method of it: either would keep the
    object alive forever. **The strong reference is the mechanism.** The finalizer
    registry references the list, so the sockets stay reachable, the collector leaves
    them out of what it frees, and they stay in the context's `WeakSet` as well. The
    loop below, which closes them from the list, is belt and braces: with it removed,
    `destroy` alone would find and close them, for as long as the list is held
    (checked 2026-09-27, Ruling 19: all of `tests/test_link.py` passed without it).
    `destroy` then terminates the context, and returns at once on a context that is
    already closed, as one is after a test fixture destroyed it first.

    **So every socket must be appended to the list the moment it exists. That is
    required, not tidiness.** A socket missing from the list is held by nothing but
    its object. When the collector frees that object, the socket is freed with it:
    its `WeakSet` entry is cleared first, `destroy` cannot see it, and `term()` waits
    for it forever -- the original deadlock, back for that one socket. `destroy`'s
    own sweep of the `WeakSet` is a backstop for `close()` only, where the object is
    alive and the set is whole. This test pins it:
    `test_an_unclosed_link_in_a_reference_cycle_is_released_by_the_collector`. With
    the REP socket's `append` removed, it fails at its 10 s bound (checked
    2026-09-27, Ruling 19).

    **Threads.** pyzmq's `destroy` docstring says it must not be called while sockets
    are active in other threads, because `Socket.close` is not threadsafe. Each
    caller runs on a thread where that holds:

    - `close()` runs it on the thread that called `close()`, where `destroy` ran
      before.
    - `ZmqLink`'s failed constructor runs it, through `close()`, on the constructing
      thread, before any caller has a handle.
    - Reference counting runs it on the thread that dropped the last reference, and
      the collector on whichever thread collected. Either way the object is
      unreachable by then, so nothing can be using its sockets. Closing them on that
      thread is what each socket's own `__del__` would have done, on that same thread.
    - `weakref.finalize` also runs a still-live finalizer at interpreter exit, on
      the main thread, as it did for the old net.

        trusts the actor named in a command *"because they are the same machine and
        the console **is** the authenticator."* Nothing enforced it. These two lines
        used to bind whatever string they were handed, so
        `wlx run --link tcp://0.0.0.0:5571,...` was accepted in silence, and after it
        any host on the lab network could move `reward_correct` or issue `Stop` under
        any `--as` name it cared to invent. The spec's premise was a sentence in a
        document and the code was a wildcard bind.

        A non-loopback endpoint is therefore refused here rather than bound, and
        `allow_remote=True` -- `wlx run --link-allow-remote` on the command line -- is
        how somebody says they meant it. It does not make a remote bind safe; it makes
        it deliberate, and it is the whole of what stands between this port and the
        network until real authentication exists.

        **That authentication is P4d-3's, and this is what it is waiting for**
        (CLAUDE.md: a "not yet" must name what it is waiting for). S9a §6 designs it:
        the box as an OAuth2 client of `wl-works`, `Actor` as `Verified(person,
        issuer, token id)` or `Local(box credential)`. The actor types exist since b2b
        (`actor.py`), and `wlx serve` makes a `Member` from a wl.works token it has
        checked (b2b slice 2, built 2026-10-05); on this socket, a `by` is still whatever the local
        sender wrote, so the loopback-only bind remains what makes that acceptable. Grep
        `P4d-3` when that authentication lands.

        `ZmqConsole` is deliberately not restricted the same way: it *connects*, and
        a console reaching a session on another host is a decision the console's own
        operator makes about where to look, not a port this process opens.

        Polls with a zero timeout -- never blocks the trial loop waiting for a
        console that has nothing to say -- looping only while `poll` reports more
        already waiting, so this returns as soon as the queue is empty rather than
        after a fixed number of checks. REP's state machine requires exactly one
        reply per request; skipping it would wedge the socket for whichever console
        sent it, so every `recv` here is paired with a `send` before the next
        `recv`. The reply means "your command reached the session," not "your
        command was applied" -- `drain` only turns bytes into `Command` objects;
        `Session.set` is where acceptance or refusal is decided, and that outcome
        reaches every console as `Staged`/`Refused` in the next `Telemetry` frame,
        not in this reply.

        **Reply before decode, always -- fix round 1, CRITICAL 2, measured.** The
        reply used to be sent only after a successful `_decode_command`, so an
        undecodable packet's exception propagated out of `drain` and out of
        `taskd.py`'s trial loop, ending the session -- measured with `{"kind":
        "pause"}`. Worse, because the reply was never sent, the REP socket was left
        owing one, so the *next* call's poll/recv against a perfectly valid command
        also failed: one garbage packet took the whole channel down, not just
        itself. Replying unconditionally, before the `try`, means a malformed packet
        can never leave the REP socket in that state.

        **Never raised, never dropped silently either.** Every way a wire packet can
        fail to become a `Command` -- bad msgpack, the wrong shape, an unknown kind
        -- is caught broadly and deliberately (`Exception`, not a narrow list) and
        turned into a `Refused` appended to `self.refused`, because refusing quietly
        is how a console (a newer build against a bumped `SCHEMA`, S9a §9, is a
        realistic source of this, not just corruption) loses a command with no
        record anywhere that anything was even attempted -- the same failure
        `Session.refusals` exists to prevent for a rejected `SetParameter`. `name`
        is a placeholder (`"<transport>"`) and `by` is `None`: a packet that
        failed to decode carries no reliable actor or parameter name to report,
        unlike a `SetParameter` that decoded fine and was rejected by `Session.set`.

        **Bounded, and the bound is the point.** The paragraph above is the argument
        for recording every one of these, and it is also the reason the list cannot
        be allowed to grow: the peer producing them is the one this end does not
        control, and the newer-console-against-a-bumped-`SCHEMA` case named there
        produces one per packet for as long as it keeps trying. `self.refused` is
        trimmed to the most recent `REFUSAL_HISTORY` and the discards are counted in
        `self.refused_dropped`, so the cap is visible on the console rather than
        being a quieter version of the silent drop this whole passage argues against.
        The trim is O(`REFUSAL_HISTORY`) and this runs once per trial boundary, never
        inside a frame.

        runs `_release` again, and that does nothing: it skips closed sockets, and
        `destroy` returns at once on a closed context.

        **`destroy`, not a bare `.term()`** -- fix round 1, measured: `ctx.term()`
        blocks on ANY socket under that context that is not yet closed (a bare probe
        script, this session's scratchpad: an unclosed socket makes `term()` hang
        indefinitely), while `destroy(linger=0)`, called the same way from ordinary
        application code, force-closes every socket the context still lists and
        returns immediately (measured: 0.0001 s against the identical unclosed
        socket). So on this path, where the link is alive and the context's
        `WeakSet` is whole, `destroy` also closes a socket a future edit opened and
        forgot to append to `self._sockets`. **That is a backstop for `close()` only,
        and the append is still required.** When the collector frees a link whose
        `close()` never ran, a socket missing from the list brings the original
        deadlock back (`_release` has why), and
        `test_an_unclosed_link_in_a_reference_cycle_is_released_by_the_collector`
        fails at its 10 s bound.

        **`_release` first, `detach()` after (Ruling 19, 2026-09-27).**
        This used to be `self._finalizer()`, and `weakref.finalize.__call__` removes
        its registry entry *before* it calls `_release`. A release interrupted
        partway -- a Ctrl-C between the two `sock.close` calls, during `wlx run`'s
        `with` exit -- therefore disarmed the net: a second `close()` did nothing, and
        the context was never terminated. A later cyclic collection of that link then
        hung (reproduced 2026-09-27, in a bare script): pyzmq's own
        `Context.__del__` calls `destroy`, which finds the `WeakSet` already cleared,
        and `term()` waits for the socket the release never reached. Now the
        finalizer stays armed until `_release` has returned, so a second `close()`,
        or the finalizer when the link is freed, finishes the release. This test
        pins it:
        `test_a_close_interrupted_partway_leaves_the_net_armed_and_a_second_close_finishes`.

        **The open item this docstring carried until 2026-09-27 is closed (Ruling
        18).** It recorded that neutering `close()` hung the suite past 300 s inside
        the `weakref.finalize(self, self._ctx.destroy, 0)` callback `__init__` used
        to register, and it concluded that only *pytest's* cyclic collector did
        that, because an explicit `gc.collect()` in a bare script returned. Both
        halves were wrong. Any cyclic collection of an unclosed link hung that way,
        in a bare script too, and the bare scripts that returned had freed their
        objects by reference counting instead. The cause was the old finalizer:
        `destroy` looked for the sockets in a `WeakSet` the collector had already
        emptied, closed nothing, and `term()` waited on them forever. `_release`'s
        docstring has the mechanism, the pyzmq and CPython source it was read from,
        and the fix. The finalizer now holds the sockets itself.

        Not part of the `Link` protocol. **Resolved 2026-09-19 (Task 6):** this
        paragraph used to name `wlx run --link` as the "not yet" nothing called
        `close()` in production was waiting for (CLAUDE.md: a "not yet" must name
        what it is waiting for, so the next reader can grep it rather than believe
        it). `wlx run --link` (`cli.py`'s `run` command) now constructs the
        `ZmqLink` this method belongs to, wrapped in `with` rather than a bare
        `try`/`finally` so `close()` cannot be forgotten -- it runs via `__exit__`
        on every exit from that command, a normal return or an exception out of
        `session.run()` alike.

        **Task 6's own fix round 1 met the same hang one file over.**
        `tests/test_cli.py`'s first end-to-end `--link` test built its own
        `ZmqLink`/`ZmqConsole` instances without `test_link.py`'s `zmq_cleanup`
        fixture, module-local at the time, and `tools/mutate.py --returns None
        wl_xcon/link.py close` hung past 300 s again. That was fixed by
        moving `zmq_cleanup` to `conftest.py`, and, for the one `ZmqLink` the test
        has no handle to register -- the one `main()` builds and closes on a
        background thread -- by an explicit `gc.collect()` after that thread
        joined. The explicit collection was safe only while reference counting
        freed that link. Once `Rig.wall_clock` put it in a `Session` cycle (P4d-2b
        b1), the explicit collection became where the deadlock happened.
        `b85d0d7` replaced it with `tests/_zmq_release.py`, and `_release` removed
        the deadlock itself.

    topics to a later slice ("a separate droppable topic" for a display-rate stream,
    "if V11 permits one"); today there is exactly one topic, so no filtering is
    needed here.

    **The settle delay after connecting reduces one real but non-critical gap; it is
    never a correctness requirement.** ZeroMQ's PUB socket does not queue a message
    for a subscriber whose subscription has not yet propagated to it -- the
    well-documented "slow joiner" behaviour -- so a console that connects and is
    published to immediately can miss that first frame. Telemetry is lossy by design
    (S9a §9) and the next published frame always arrives regardless, so a console
    that keeps reading is never actually stuck -- this delay only spares a human
    opening a console the sight of a gap before the very first frame. `settle_s`
    (default 0.05, i.e. 50 ms) is a parameter rather than a hard-coded sleep so a
    test can set it to `0` and prove the system is still correct without it --
    `test_the_system_still_works_with_no_settle_delay` in `test_link.py` does exactly
    that, using retries rather than a second sleep to observe the (still real, just
    unmitigated) gap resolve itself. 50 ms was measured on this machine to be well
    clear of the problem at the default (0 misses in 1000 back-to-back trials, this
