"""Fluid and session-duration accounting, and the only path from a task to the pump.

**Welfare-critical. Human review required before merge** (CLAUDE.md, S8 §7).
**S8 §5.2 and §5.2c carry the arguments** -- which PI ruling set each limit and
when, and the failures each guard was written against. They are there so that this
file is what a reviewer can hold in their head: one sentence per rule, and the
refusal messages an operator actually reads.

- `bounds.py` holds the limits and the arithmetic; this holds the state -- the day's
  running total, two clocks, a pump -- and joining them is the whole of its job.
- **Fluid has a floor, not a ceiling** (PI, 2026-09-06): no delivery is refused on
  volume, and the day's shortfall is reported at close so a person can supplement.
- **One duration limit: out of the cage to back in it**, eight hours (PI,
  2026-09-19; the figure as he corrected it on 2026-10-01). Chair time is recorded
  and bounds nothing; there is no trial cap.
  **Both ends of that interval are wall-clock times** (PI, 2026-09-20): the frame clock
  stops when the frames do, so a return read from it left the unchairing and the walk
  back outside the limit. **And every duration here is read on the wall** (P4d-2a
  spec §10, 2026-09-26): the marks are kept as the wall instants they are, restraint
  included, and the frame clock -- which a simulator counts without waiting for, so
  it outran the wall -- never enters this file. **The wall they are read on is here
  too** (`SessionClock`, P4d-2a final review): the host clock read once and carried
  forward on a steady clock that counts the time the host is asleep, since that
  arithmetic decides the interval as much as any method below does. **The session
  warns as the limit approaches** (PI,
  2026-09-20) so a block can be finished deliberately rather than cut mid-sequence --
  `approaching_limit`, at `WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT`, which he accepted the same day as a
  starting value.
- **Either mark more than thirty minutes from now is confirmed by a person** (PI,
  2026-09-20), or amended with a reason and a name. They are clock times, so a typo
  of a few hours -- `15:45` for `18:45` -- passes every refusal there is;
  `departure_needs_confirmation`, `return_needs_confirmation` and `amend_mark` are
  the mitigation, the marks themselves refuse an unconfirmed one, and
  `CONFIRM_MARK_WITHIN` is his figure.
- **Three deployment kinds, not two** (PI, 2026-09-20): head-fixation is a property
  of the deployment rather than of being on a rig. **S8 §5.2 item 4 has the table**
  of which marks each kind requires, refuses and event-codes; the one thing to carry
  away here is that `chair_seconds` is **absent, never zero**, for a kind that takes
  no head-fixation marks.
- **`Rig` is the only route from a task's `Reward` to fluid**, so "can anything
  deliver reward without the day's accounting seeing it" is a one-file question.
- A missing floor, a missing mark, an unconfigured pump, a value that is not a real
  number, or a negative magnitude all **refuse**: in each case the bad thing is
  indistinguishable from a benign one to anything that answers zero. *An instant is
  finite; a magnitude is finite and not negative* (`bounds._finite`/`_magnitude`,
  S8 §5.2c; `tests/test_welfare.py` enumerates every door).
- An **unknown** prior total does not refuse -- it leaves the shortfall `None` and
  keeps paying. A refusal to claim the day went well, not a refusal to pay.

**No millilitres-to-open-time conversion lives here**: the pump calibration has never
been measured, so `Pump` takes millilitres and P7 owns the driver. **The out-of-cage
marks get no event code** -- PI, 2026-09-20, closing S8 open item 8: they are
operator-entered rather than measured, so a hardware timestamp would add precision to
a number that never had it, and our own log and the session directory already carry
them. A restart therefore re-asks a person for the departure time, by design.

#: is not a twenty-fourth of anything and nothing here computes it, so it may not be
#: re-derived from the ceiling -- a session under a shorter ceiling keeps this
#: threshold and simply has no band (see `departure_needs_confirmation`).
#:
#: **It is 1,800 and so is `WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT`, and the two are unrelated.** Both
#: are the PI's since 2026-09-20 and they still are not the same number twice: that one
#: is a *starting* value for a line that bounds nothing and may be tuned by any lab;
#: this one is a threshold on a mark that bounds a session. Deriving either from the
#: other would make tuning a console warning quietly move a welfare guard, so they are
#: separate constants that happen to agree. S8 §5.2 item 4 carries both rulings.
#:
#: **It applies to both marks** (PI, 2026-09-20, ruling 4): the return is a clock time
#: too, and one typed hours ago moves the same interval, in the direction that makes a
#: session look shorter than it was. It was `CONFIRM_DEPARTURE_WITHIN` for the few hours

    **Why not `time.monotonic()`** (P4d-2a final review I1, 2026-09-26, ledger Ruling
    11): it stops while the host sleeps. `SessionClock` carries the session's wall
    forward on this, so a clock that stopped for a suspend put the session's wall
    behind real time by the length of the suspend -- a return typed `now` recorded
    early, the interval short, and `must_stop` late, all in the unsafe direction.
    Chosen per platform, from the primary sources:

    - **Linux** (the rig): `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`, "identical to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, except
      that it also includes any time that the system is suspended" -- Linux
      man-pages 6.19, clock_getres(2), dated 2026-03-07, read at man7.org on
      2026-09-26; Linux 2.6.39 and later, and `time.CLOCK_BOOTTIME` from Python 3.7
      (Python docs, `time`, read the same day). `time.monotonic()` there is
      `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, which does not count a suspend.
    - **macOS**: `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, which "will continue to increment while the
      system is asleep" -- clock_gettime(3), the macOS 27.0 SDK's page, dated January
      26, 2016, read on this host on 2026-09-26. `time.monotonic()` there is
      `mach_absolute_time()` (`time.get_clock_info`), which the same page gives as
      `CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW`, which "does not increment while the system is asleep".
      Measured on this host the same day (Python 3.12): `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`'s reading
      was 111,336 s ahead of `time.monotonic()`'s, and `CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW`'s agreed
      with it to under a microsecond.
    - **Anywhere else**: `time.monotonic()`, which **is not assumed to count time
      asleep** -- whether it does there is UNVERIFIED -- so a suspend on such a host
      puts the session's wall behind by its length, the unsafe direction. No such
      host runs a session today.

    **Chosen on every reading rather than once at import**, so a test can stub the
    platform (`tests/test_welfare.py`); the cost is one attribute lookup, and this
    is read at trial boundaries, for each published frame, at each mark and, since
    P4d-2b spec §4.1, once per reward -- the last of these inside a trial rather
    than at one of its boundaries -- never per frame of a trial.

    **Here, in the reviewed file, since the P4d-2a final review** (I5, 2026-09-26,
    ledger Ruling 12). It was `taskd.Session`'s, and it decides the out-of-cage
    interval as surely as any method of `Welfare` does: every `wall_now` those
    methods are given comes from it. `Welfare` itself still reads no clock -- the
    reading is passed in, so a test can hand it any instant -- and `taskd.Session`
    holds one of these and passes its readings on, unless a test injects a wall of
    its own.

    **Anchored, not read afresh** (Ruling 8, Task 7 fix round 1): `time.time()` as it
    read when the clock was created, carried forward on `steady_seconds()`.
    `time.time()` can be stepped mid-session, by NTP or by a person setting the host
    clock, and a backward step would shrink the out-of-cage interval by its size.
    So out-of-cage is departure to return in steady seconds, **the time the host
    spent asleep included** (I1), however the host clock moves in between.

    **The cost, stated:** a session inherits whatever offset the host clock had when
    it was created, exactly as `time.time()` would have, and an adjustment made to
    the host clock mid-session is not seen until the next session. A clock time an
    operator types is read on the host calendar (`cli._wall_clock_time`), so the two
    agree at the session's start and differ afterwards only by whatever adjustment
    the host clock has taken since -- which is why `wlx run` reads the return's `now`
    from here rather than from `time.time()`.

    A reading that is not a real number is refused where it is used: every method
    of `Welfare` that takes a `wall_now` checks it (`bounds._finite`) -- **except
    `deliver`** (P4d-2b spec §4.1). Its `wall_now` becomes `last_delivery_wall_at`, a

        stop would read as though a choice were still open. `warn_within` of zero
        therefore never warns, which is how the warning is switched off.

        **And `None` once the return is recorded** (P4d-2a final review I2,
        2026-09-26). The interval is closed and the animal is home, so there is
        nothing left to bring back. This read the closed interval against the
        threshold until then, and a return made inside the band left "start bringing
        the animal back" on the closed frame -- the last one a console keeps. Past
        the ceiling, the stop reason and the closed interval itself carry the fact.

        **This bounds nothing**, which is why `warn_within` may have a default at all
        (`WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT`): whatever it is set to, the session ends at the same
        instant. `wall_now` is a POSIX instant, as `must_stop`'s is.

@dataclass
class Rig:
    """A trial's outbound I/O: the card, and the only path to the pump.

    What a task's `Mark` and `Reward` actions actually reach (`run.Effects`). It
    lives here rather than beside the loop so the whole route from a task's
    declaration to fluid is readable in one file.

    **Nothing is swallowed.** There is no fluid ceiling (PI, 2026-09-06), so the
    only way `deliver` fails is a pump that will not answer -- a broken rig, not the
    design working, and absorbing it would produce a session of correct trials
    nobody was paid for. An earlier version caught a ceiling here and stopped at the
    next trial boundary; the shape was right and the premise was not, and a
    *stopping* condition arriving mid-trial still belongs here rather than raising
    out of the frame loop.

    **`wall_clock` is `taskd.Session.wall_now`, and nothing else** -- the session's
    `SessionClock` above, or the wall a test injected -- read once per reward so
    `Welfare.deliver` can record the instant the reward was commanded, kept once the
    pump returns (P4d-2b spec §4.1): one clock read and one float store on the
    trial's path, per reward and never per frame. **The one
    anchored clock, not a second one** (P4d-2a Ruling 8): the reward's instant is on
    the base the departure, the return and every published frame are. Required, with
    no default: a default of `time.time` would be that second clock -- off the anchor
    by any step of the host clock since the session began, and off an injected wall
    entirely.

    **This closes a reference cycle** (Ruling 4, fix round 1): `taskd.Session` holds
    this `Rig` (`self.rig`), and this `Rig` holds `wall_clock`, a bound method whose
    `__self__` is that same `Session`. `Session` -> `rig` -> `wall_clock` -> `Session`
    is a cycle no refcount alone collects; only Python's cyclic collector frees a
    finished session's chain. **`wlx taskd` holds many sessions a day** (P4d-2b b3a), so
    it collects once as each session closes -- between sessions, never during a run
    (`service.Service._end`). `wlx run` holds one per process, freed at exit. Managing
    the collector during a run, CLAUDE.md's hot-path rule, is open for both
    (docs/backlog.md, XC-047).
