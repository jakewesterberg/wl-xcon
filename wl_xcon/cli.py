    **With no terminal, nothing waits, console attached or not** (Task 8). A linked
    run with no terminal has nobody who could ever answer the prompt -- the ELN's

    slice once planned to build for the purpose was ruled out with it -- so
    `await_return` is not even started; one `return not recorded (no terminal)` row

    `True` if the operator interrupted, so the caller can exit 130 as `wlx console`
    does.

    without being refused by the mark it already accepted.

    **Does not call `session.end()`** (Task 9 fix round 1). It used to, in its own

    run command that happens *before* this function is ever called -- a refused or
    interrupted departure prompt, chiefly. `main` now owns `end()` from an outer
    `finally` that wraps this call along with everything before it, so `session
    ended` is still always the last row a run writes (this function's own writes,
    `returned`/`return not recorded`, all land first, `main`'s `finally` runs only
    once this function has returned or raised past it) -- just from one caller

def render(frame: _link.Telemetry | _link.Idle) -> str:
    """One screen's worth of a `Telemetry` frame -- S9a §4's panes this slice has
    data for: fluid, chair, trials by outcome, what is still owed, staged changes
    and refusals. `wlx console`'s only view of a running session.

    **`in session` and `phase` (P4d-2a spec §10 item 3).** The in-session clock is
    the PI's second one, apart from out-of-cage and bounding nothing -- it has no
    limit to warn about, unlike the line above it -- and `phase` names where in the
    session's life this frame was taken: `running`, `awaiting return` (a rig
    session's post-loop clock, still open), or `closed` (the return recorded).

    **Every line names a field of `Telemetry`; nothing here is computed.** That is
    the same discipline `Telemetry.of` itself follows (S9a §9, `link.py`), one hop
    further out: a renderer that summed or derived a number instead of printing the
    field would be a second implementation that could quietly disagree with the
    record the moment the two drifted apart.

    **Unknown prints `UNKNOWN`, never `0.0`.** `fluid_today_ml`/`shortfall_ml` are
    `None` exactly when `welfare.shortfall()` refused to guess (see `link.py`'s
    module docstring), and `wlx run` already renders that refusal as `UNKNOWN`
    rather than a confident zero. This must agree with it -- a console and a
    headless run disagreeing about whether a day is known would be the same
    failure surfacing twice, differently.

    **An absent number says which absence it is, and never prints as zero.**
    `chair_seconds` is `None` for the two deployment kinds that take no
    head-fixation marks (PI, 2026-09-20), and the two have different reasons: a
    cage-side animal is never restrained, and a chaired one is restrained and
    unmarked. Rendering either as `0:00` would report a measurement nothing took,
    which on the restraint clock is the same failure `fluid today: UNKNOWN` exists
    to prevent on the fluid one. `deployment` is on the frame so this line can name
    the reason rather than infer it from which fields came through empty.

    **The two fluid lines are the condition of a welfare ruling, not a readout.**
    A reward volume of zero is *allowed* -- pausing reward without ending a session
    -- and the PI allowed it on 2026-09-20 **because it is visible**: `fluid
    session: 0.00 mL` is how an operator sees that a correctly-working animal is
    being paid nothing, and `supplement:` keeps reporting the whole floor as owed so
    it is topped up afterwards. **A change that stopped showing either would turn a
    permitted operation into a silent one** -- a welfare regression reached by
    simplifying a console pane, which is exactly why this sentence is here and not
    only in S8 §5.2c.

    **And a session at `0.00 mL` may be working as designed** (PI, 2026-09-20): a
    trial may have a reward period paying an on-screen *token* rather than fluid,
    converting to fluid later. So this line is not a fault indicator, and `supplement`
    is what still says what the animal is owed. Nothing in the task vocabulary models
    that token yet -- S8 §5.3.

    **Staged changes are shown with who staged them, and so are refusals.** S9a §8
    removed the write lock; staged visibility -- to every console, not only the one
    that staged it -- is what replaces it, so a change already accepted must be
    visible. Refusals are the audit trail for a write that did *not* happen: a
    person who mistyped a parameter name needs to see that on screen, not only in a
    log nobody is watching.

    **A capped refusal feed says so.** `Telemetry.refusals` keeps only the most
    recent `link.REFUSAL_HISTORY`, because a peer this end does not control decides
    how fast they arrive. `refusals_dropped` is printed above the rows rather than
    below them -- a reader scans down, and learning at the bottom that the fifty
    lines above were the tail of four hundred is learning it too late.

    **A staged row says which vocabulary the name belongs to, and that it applies at
    the next trial** (PI, 2026-09-19). Both kinds defer: `Session._apply_staged`
    writes an ordinary task parameter into `spec.values` and a welfare-bounded one
    onto its ceiling, in the same pass, and the trial running now uses the old value
    either way. The two are still named apart because the stakes are -- a reward
    volume and a fixation hold are not the same row to read past.

    This screen briefly said `ALREADY IN EFFECT` of a bounded row, and that was
    true when it was written: `Session.set` moved the ceiling as the command was
    drained. Saying it now would be the same lie in the more dangerous direction --
    an operator who has just *lowered* a reward volume, told it has taken effect
    while one more trial is still to go out at the old one. `taskd.Session.set` and
    `bounds.Bounds.validate` carry the behaviour and why it changed.

    **A volume is printed to 2 decimal places, like every other fluid figure on this
    screen.** `reward_correct` appears on the staged line, and printing it at raw
    `repr` while the fluid lines above use `:.2f` puts `0.15 -> 0.3` and `0.30 mL` on
    the same screen for the same quantity.

    **Schema 7 adds the configuration and the limits** (P4d-2b b1): which task,
    allocation and bounded config; fluid today against the day's floor; the
    out-of-cage clock against the ceiling it is stopped on; the instant the last
    reward was commanded, kept once the pump returned; the parameter rows; and the
    last outcomes. Each absence is a word --
    *PROVISIONAL*, *not given*, *none yet*, *unset*, *open* -- never a zero.

    **Schema 8 adds the controls** (P4d-2b b2a): whether the session is paused and
    since when, the scheduled stop and who set it -- in the rig's own words -- and
    the recent control events, each with who sent it, below the staged rows. A capped
    feed says so above its rows, as the refusal feed does. Absences are words again:
    *no*, *none*.

    **Every wire-sourced string is run through `_printable` before it reaches this
    screen** (fix round 1, IMPORTANT). `link.py`'s `decode` checks a string's type
    and length, never its printability, and a box-local peer's mark note, `by`,
    refusal reason or any other free text is echoed here verbatim otherwise. Left
    unescaped, a control character can move the terminal's cursor or clear its
    screen, and an embedded newline can forge a line of this function's own output
    -- including a `STOPPED:` or `WARNING:` line nothing actually raised. Numbers
    this function formats itself, and the lines and labels it composes itself, need
    no such treatment; only text read off `frame` (or an object reached from it)
    does.

    **Schema 10 adds runs and the service** (P4d-2b b3a): the run, whether `wlx taskd`
    holds the session, the pre-flight of the run about to start, and a question owed; an
    `Idle` frame is `_render_idle`'s.
