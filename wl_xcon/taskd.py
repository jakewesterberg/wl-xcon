"""`taskd` — running a session end to end.

The pieces joined: a task loaded and checked, a world to run it against, blocks drawn
from a scheduler, ceilings that can end the session, and the record written as it
goes. On a rig the world is hardware; here it is a behaviour agent. **The loop cannot
tell them apart** (S6 §6), which is the property that makes a simulated session
evidence about a real one rather than a rehearsal of it.

**A session is the block session with one block.** A run of N trials is expressed as
a single unnamed block rather than as a second loop, because a second loop is a
second place for the ceilings to be checked -- and a limit enforced in one of two
paths is a limit that depends on which path a session took.

**Reached over the link.** `Session.link` drains commands into `Session.set` and
publishes telemetry, once per trial boundary and never per frame (below); `wlx run
--link` and `wlx taskd` bind it to ZMQ (`link.ZmqLink`), and `wlx console` and `wlx
serve` are the other end. **A run `wlx taskd` starts is checked before it starts**
(`preflight.py`, under S9a §10's rule); a `wlx run` run is not, and the two refusals
below stand before every run of either.

**Two refusals stand between a session and its first trial**, and both are the shape
this file exists to hold. A task with a blocking finding does not run, because a
session that begins and *then* discovers the task is malformed has already put an
animal in a chair. And a session that has not satisfied `welfare.preflight` does not
run: a rig session needs the mark that starts the eight-hour out-of-cage clock (PI,
2026-09-19), and `Deployment.RIG_FIXED` additionally needs the head-fixation that
records restraint, while a cage-side one declares `Deployment.CAGE_SIDE` and needs
neither. The declaration is on `SessionSpec` rather than inferred, because a rig
session nobody marked and a kiosk session with nothing to mark are indistinguishable
to anything that guesses.

**Three deployment kinds since 2026-09-20 (PI)**, and this file is where two of the
consequences land: `head_released` is emitted at the end of a run only for the kind
that was fixed, and `link.Telemetry` carries the declaration so a console can say
which absence it is looking at. `welfare.Deployment` has the table.

        **Validated now, applied at the next trial boundary -- every name alike**
        (PI, 2026-09-19). A value is refused at the moment it is offered, so the
        console hears about it while a person is still looking; nothing is assigned
        here, so no trial is ever re-priced under way.

        Two vocabularies, deliberately: a **welfare-bounded** name is checked by
        `bounds.validate` against its ceiling, and an ordinary one against the task's
        own `Param` declaration. Reward volume is in the first, which is why the
        console can adjust it and cannot exceed it. Both then go on `_staged` and
        both are applied by `_apply_staged()` at the top of the pass *after* the one
        that drained them (S8 §3.2: a parameter that changed under a running trial
        makes that trial's record a description of neither value).
        `test_a_queued_commands_staged_value_is_visible_before_it_applies` and
        `test_a_welfare_bounded_change_applies_at_the_next_boundary_like_any_other`
        pin the two halves: trial 0 runs under the old value either way.

        **A welfare-bounded name used to be different, and that is what this fixed.**
        `bounds.set` was called here, as the command was drained, so the new volume
        was live for the trial that ran later in that same pass -- `run()` drains,
        publishes, and only then calls `run_trial` -- while `link.Staged` reported it
        `staged` and the `PARAM_CHANGED` strobe and `parameter_changes.jsonl` row
        landed a pass later still. The ceiling held throughout, so it was never
        over-delivery; it was **fluid attribution off by one trial**, and anyone
        reconciling commanded fluid against that file offline assigned one trial's
        delivery to the wrong value. Deferring costs an operator who has just lowered
        a volume one more trial at the old one, which the PI weighed and chose.
        `bounds.validate` carries the welfare-side account of the same change.

        **`was` is the value before this ITI, not before this row.** Two sets of one
        name in a single drain both record the same `was`, because neither has been
        applied when the second is staged -- so the rows read `0.15 -> 0.30` and
        `0.15 -> 0.20` and the second wins (S9a §8's last-write-wins, both actors
        recorded). A reader must take the last row's `now` for the interval and must
        not chain or sum them; a bounded name is the one where doing so would
        mis-attribute fluid, which is the thing this method was changed to stop.

        `index` is the trial about to run, carried only so a recorded refusal can
        say where in the session it happened -- see `record.SessionRecord.refusal`.

        **Refusals do not end the session.** A person mistyping a parameter name is
        not a fault of the rig, and ending a session with an animal in the chair over
        a typo is a worse outcome than ignoring it. The refusal is recorded.

        **A refusal of a ceiling-bounded name also goes into the session record**
        (PI, 2026-09-19). Everything else here is telemetry, and telemetry is lossy
        by design (S9a §9) -- an attempt to set a dose above its limit left no
        durable trace unless a console happened to be attached. An ordinary
        parameter typo stays telemetry-only; `record.SessionRecord.refusal` carries
        why the two are not treated alike.

        **The list is capped, like the two beside it.** `ZmqLink.refused` and
        `Telemetry.refusals` are both bounded at `link.REFUSAL_HISTORY` with the
        discards counted, because the party driving their growth is an untrusted
        network peer rather than the operator -- one entry per `SetParameter` it
        sends, as fast as it can send them. This list is driven by exactly the same
        peer and was the third one, unbounded.

        **Nothing arriving here is accepted once the loop has ended but a manual reward
        or a mark's note in a `wlx taskd` session** (P4d-2a spec §10, Task 8; P4d-2b spec
        §6.0). A parameter staged after the last trial could never be applied, and a stop
        has nothing left to stop -- both are refused with the reason rather than silently
        kept. The page's return is `EndSession`, which `wlx taskd` takes itself
        (`service.Service._end`) and never routes here. A manual reward is handed to
        `_manual_reward` before anything else, in every phase, and it gives one while the
        animal's return is awaited.

        **`held` is true only for a command `_hold` drained** (P4d-2b b2a, amended
        2026-09-28): the session held paused at this boundary. Only a manual reward
        reads it (`_manual_reward`): during a run the PI's manual reward is given while
        paused, and never while a pause drained in this same pass has yet to hold.

        designed.

        volume were written *after* the first trial rewarded at it. Applying and
        recording in the same pass is what puts the row immediately before the first
        trial it describes, which is what an offline reconciliation of commanded
        fluid reads it as. The two branches below differ only in where the value
        lives -- a welfare ceiling or the task's own values -- never in when.

        **Bounded values go back through `bounds.set`, which re-validates.** The
        ceiling check is cheap and belongs to `bounds`; asking it again at the moment
        of assignment costs nothing and means no path reaches a ceiling without one.

        **"Atomically" is true because that re-validation cannot fail here, not
        because this loop is transactional.** Every staged value was validated at
        offer time, `Ceiling` is frozen, and nothing reassigns `spec.bounds` while a
        session runs -- so `bounds.set` below raises on no reachable path today. **If

        leave the earlier rows applied and `_staged` uncleared, and the validation
        would have to move to a pass of its own above the assignments before that
        change ships. Named so the next reader can grep it rather than believe it.

        """Keep a rig session's out-of-cage clock visible until the animal is home.

        **P4d-2a.** Since ruling 4 (PI, 2026-09-20) the interval runs on the wall
        until the return, but nothing published it after the last trial, so a console
        showed a frozen clock and a limit crossed after the loop was seen by nobody.
        This publishes a frame every `heartbeat` seconds -- **a display cadence for a
        console, not a measurement of this system**, and well inside `ZmqConsole`'s
        5 s receive timeout so a waiting console never times out between frames -- with
        the clock read from the wall, as every welfare duration is (P4d-2a spec §10).

        **Draining the link is for post-loop refusals now, never for the return
        itself** (P4d-2a spec §10, Task 8). It used to be where the return could
        arrive too, drained here and routed by `_command` to `returned_to_cage`; the
        PI ruled the wl-works ELN owns the return, not a console, so `link.py` carried
        no such command until P4d-2b b3a's `EndSession`, which is `wlx taskd`'s and is
        refused here like any other command after the loop. What still arrives here is
        a late `SetParameter` or `Stop`, and `_command` still refuses both with the
        session's one sentence for the post-loop phase (see its own docstring) and puts
        the refusal on the wire for whoever is watching.

        **It ends when the return is recorded, by the terminal alone, from another
        thread** (`cli._close_interval` runs this method on a background thread while
        `_settle_return` holds the terminal prompt on its own) -- this loop notices
        through `welfare.returned_wall_at`, never by being told, and then publishes
        one `closed` frame. **It never ends on its own otherwise**: `give_up` is its
        owner's to set, and then it publishes nothing further and the owner writes
        `return_not_recorded`.

        **A head a fault left fixed is released first.** `run()` releases it at a
        normal end, but a fault re-raises past that, and `welfare` refuses a return
        while the head is recorded as fixed. Head-post release bounds nothing (PI,
        2026-09-19, restated 2026-09-26), so it is marked here rather than asked for.

        **One frame naming the fault, then it propagates unchanged** -- the same rule
        `run()`'s own `except Exception as fault:` follows (fix round 1), covering
        whatever this method's own work can still raise -- the head release on entry
        (final review M7), `link.drain()`, `_command`, `_publish()` -- now that
        `returned_to_cage` is never one of them. Left
        unguarded, such an exception would escape with `phase` stuck at
        `awaiting_return` forever, no `closed` frame, and -- on the background thread
        `cli._close_interval` runs this on -- a traceback nobody joins. This publishes
        one `fault` frame, unguarded as `run()`'s is (a second failure here chains
        onto the first rather than hiding it), and then re-raises. **Surfacing that
        exception is the thread's owner's job, never this method's**:
        `cli._close_interval` re-raises it on the main thread rather than swallowing
        or retrying it. A write failure recording the return itself is no longer this
        method's to guard at all -- `returned_to_cage` runs only on the terminal's own
        thread now, and `test_a_failed_row_write_is_never_swallowed`
        (`tests/test_taskd.py`) pins that it is not swallowed there.

        A cage-side session has no interval, and this returns at once.
