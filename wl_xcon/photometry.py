"""Colour as a physical claim, checked against a measured display.

**RGB is not a colour.** It is a triple of instructions to one particular panel,
so the same task file is a different stimulus on every monitor, and a methods
section quoting it describes nothing reproducible. Everything here is specified in
a device-independent space and converted, at load, against a calibration somebody
measured with a photometer.

The word that forces this is *isoluminant*. It is the control condition of most
chromatic experiments, it is a claim about photometry, and an unmeasured claim of
isoluminance is usually false -- so this module makes stating it require a
calibration that names whose luminous efficiency it was measured against. A
macaque's is not a human's.

**As of 2026-08-31 no calibration for our panels exists.** The `Calibration` in the
tests is illustrative. A real one is measured and committed under
`docs/measurements/`, per CLAUDE.md's rule on timing and physical claims.
