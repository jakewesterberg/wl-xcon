"""Pre-flight: what is checked before a run starts (P4d-2b spec §6.2), under S9a §10's
one rule.

**The rule** (PI, 2026-09-19): **fail** blocks; **unknown** proceeds only on an
acknowledgement, by name, written into the record (`runs.jsonl`); **pass** proceeds. The
failure it is shaped against is a gate that cries wolf and gets clicked through, so it
refuses only on evidence of a problem and records acceptance where evidence is merely
absent. `gate` is the rule; the items are what it is asked about: the task's load-time
checks in the session's setup, the run's warnings not yet accepted this session (engine
build B), its starting values, the animal's bounded config and, in the stereoscope, its
settings, the out-of-cage mark and limit, and the two things nothing measures yet.

**Welfare-critical: `out_of_cage` and `gate`** (`docs/design/architecture.md`). The first
is what refuses a new run once the out-of-cage limit is reached between runs (spec §6.1);
the second is what lets an unknown through. The other items are ordinary: each is an
item a person reads, and a wrong one fails or passes a run that `taskd` still checks
itself -- `Session.run` refuses a blocking finding and a missing mark on its own.
`unmeasured`'s pump rule is off the list by the PI's ruling (2026-09-30), with
`service._Routed.drain`: both were proposed for it at the b3a-1 review and taken back off.

**No pre-flight ends the service**: nothing a task file or its declarations do raises out
of `task` or `values`, and `service.Service._preflight` turns whatever any item's check
raises into that item's fail.
