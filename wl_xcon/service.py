"""`wlx taskd` -- the rig service (P4d-2b spec §6.1).

One process on the rig PC, all day: idle until a console opens a session, then one
animal's session across as many runs as the operator starts, until its return to the cage
is recorded, and then idle again for the next animal. **All of one animal's welfare state
lives in one `taskd.Session`** (PI, 2026-09-29: "One always-on rig service"), which is
the shape S9a §7 drew; nothing carries from one session to the next.

Its commands are the link's -- `OpenSession`, `CheckRun`, `StartRun`, `EndSession` and
`ResumeSession` beside b2a's -- over the socket `wlx run --link` binds. **They are read
once per housekeeping pass while no run is in progress, and at each trial boundary during
one**, never per frame (the b3a-1 plan, decision 18). A run sees the link through `_Routed`:
**an `EndSession` during a run stops it**, and the session ends once the run has
returned; any other of the service's own commands during a run is refused, never kept
for later. **Every run is checked before it starts** (`_start`): its pre-flight taken
again, and S9a §10's rule asked of it -- fail blocks, an unknown proceeds only on a named
acknowledgement written into `runs.jsonl`. **A run's fault is contained** (decision 14):
published, written into its end row, said on stderr, and the session left open between
runs with its animal still out, so the return can be taken.

**After a crash, nothing new opens until the stranded session is ended or resumed** (spec
§6.1; XC-026). On start the service finds every session under `--root` with a departure
and no return (`stranded.find`), and while one exists it opens no session, for that
animal or any other, until an `EndSession` naming it records the return -- **or a
`ResumeSession` naming it resumes that same session from its record** (XC-026,
`_resume`), which is not a new one. A record that cannot carry a resume is refused one,
so its only recovery is its return.

**A confirm or an amend is taken only as the answer to a question this service posed**
(the b3a-1 review's Ruling 1, 2026-09-29; `_unasked`). The PI's rule for a far mark is a
warning the experimenter must click through (2026-09-20), and the wire cannot tell a
click-through from a confirm sent blind in the first request. So a far mark with no
answer puts a `Question` on the frame; an answer is taken while that question is pending,
for its mark, its session and the instant it asked about -- and, for a departure, the
animal, deployment and setup of the open it was asked about; and **the question stays
until it is answered or another replaces it**, so a refused answer -- an amendment with
no reason -- can be corrected and sent again without the warning being lost.

**Every mark is taken on one thread** (the b3a-1 review's Ruling 2): the departure, its
amendment, the head's fixation and release and the return are each taken while a command
is routed, on the thread running `serve`, one command at a time -- which is what lets
`taskd.Session.returned_to_cage` run without the lock it once had.

**Welfare-critical: `Service._open`, `Service._end` (with `Service._unended`, its
refusals before anything is stopped or marked), `Service._close_stranded`,
`Service._start`, `_unasked` and `_folder_name`** (`docs/design/architecture.md`): the
page's route into the two marks, the stranded rule, which answers are taken, the gate a
run passes before it starts, and the rule that keeps a name from any wire or record from
becoming a path out of `--subjects` or `--tasks`. The rest is ordinary.

**The simulators, today**: the card, the pump and the animal are `wlx run`'s, because no
hardware port exists (docs/CHECKPOINT.md: nothing has touched hardware); a rig's own
replace them when they do.
