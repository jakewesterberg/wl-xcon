"""The two marks that bound the out-of-cage interval, decided once for every caller.

**Welfare-critical, the whole module** (CLAUDE.md; `docs/design/architecture.md`). Human
review before merge.

The PI ruled on 2026-09-29 that the page takes the departure and the return "under the
terminal's exact rules", through "one shared piece of code" (P4d-2b spec §6.0, §6.2).
This is that code. `welfare` holds the rules -- what is refused, and when a person must
confirm -- and this module holds the decision a caller makes around them, which until
slice b3a lived inside `wlx run`'s prompts (`cli._settle_departure`,
`cli._settle_return`): whether a far mark was confirmed or amended, by whom and how, and
the row that says so. The terminal keeps its prompting and `wlx taskd` its sentences;
neither decides.

- **Parsing**: `clock_time` and `clock_or_now` turn what a person typed into an instant.
  Moved here from `cli` unchanged (they were `_wall_clock_time` and `_clock_or_now`,
  and `cli` still reaches them by those names), so the page's text is read by the
  terminal's own parser.
- **The departure**: `decide_departure` turns an instant and a person's answer -- none,
  `Confirm` or `Amend` -- into a `Departure`, or raises `Owed` for a far one nobody has
  answered; `depart` marks it; `record_departure` writes the confirmation's or the
  amendment's row, after the mark and never before.
- **The return**: `take_return` marks it, or raises `Owed` for a far one nobody
  confirmed. **There is no amendment for a return** (the terminal's rule, P4d-2a spec
  §3): nothing has been marked that one could replace, so a corrected time is simply
  typed again.
- **The page**: `page_departure` and `page_return` take the text and the answer a
  console sent, and go through the same functions.

`session` is a `taskd.Session`. For a return, `target` is anything with `wall_now`,
`return_needs_confirmation` and `returned_to_cage` as `Session` has them -- a
`stranded.Restored` is the other. Untyped for the reason `link.Telemetry.of` gives:
`taskd` imports `cli`, which imports this module.

    **Welfare-critical** (P4d-2a final review I5, when it was `cli._wall_clock_time`;
    whole, with this module, since b3a; `docs/design/architecture.md`): it turns what an
    operator types into the instants
    that bound the out-of-cage interval -- the departure, and a return typed as a
    clock time -- so a mistake here moves the one limit a session has, and a change
    here wants the same human review as `welfare.py`.

    **Two resolutions are stated here rather than left implicit**, because the PI
    asked for both to be decided (2026-09-20):

    - **Timezone: this host's local zone.** A value with no offset is read in the
      zone the lab machine is configured for, which is the clock on the wall the
      operator is reading. A value that carries its own offset is honored as given.
    - **Date: today, on this host, and never rolled back.** A bare `HH:MM` later than
      now is refused as being in the future rather than quietly becoming a departure
      twenty-three hours ago. An overnight departure is typed with its date.
    - **The two daylight-saving hours, both resolved and neither silent.** Measured
      on a CET/CEST host, 2026-09-20: an **ambiguous** local time -- the repeated
      hour when clocks go back -- takes the *first* occurrence, which `astimezone()`
      gives by leaving `fold` at 0 (`2026-10-25T02:30` resolves to `+02:00`). A
      **nonexistent** one -- the skipped hour when clocks go forward -- is moved
      *forward*: `2026-03-29T02:30` resolves to `03:30+02:00`. The directions differ
      and so does what they cost. The ambiguous case takes the earlier instant, so
      the interval comes out up to an hour **longer** than meant, which is the safe
      direction for a ceiling. **The nonexistent case is the unsafe one**: the
      departure is read up to an hour later than meant, so the animal is reported as
      having been out up to an hour *less* than it has. Once a year, on one hour, in
      one direction -- and the interval printed at session start is what surfaces it,
      since an operator who typed a real time then reads a figure an hour short of
      the wall clock.

      **Closed by the PI on 2026-09-20 -- closed, not fixed.** *"the dst switches
      happen in the night, when no experiments occur."* So the skipped hour cannot be
      typed as a departure, and the arithmetic above is left exactly as it is rather
      than special-cased for a value nothing can produce.

      **The description above stays because the dismissal is conditional on that
      fact and not on the arithmetic.** If night sessions ever start -- an overnight
      protocol, a cage-side kiosk running unattended (S13) -- the hour comes back
      with them, and whoever reads this then needs to find what would happen rather
      than a note saying it was considered and closed. `2026-03-29T02:30` still
      resolves to `03:30+02:00`, and that still reports an animal as out up to an
      hour less than it has been.

    Rolling back would have been the convenient choice and is the wrong one: it turns
    `23:59` mistyped in the morning into an animal recorded as out for most of a day,
    which is precisely the plausible-typo class this flag's refusals exist for.

    Returning a POSIX float, not a `datetime`: `welfare` compares it with other wall
    instants and does nothing else with it, and handing it a rich object would put
    calendar arithmetic inside a welfare-critical file.

    **The departure has no `now` spelling, and is read a moment from the session's
    wall being anchored** to the host clock (`welfare.SessionClock`, Ruling 8): at the
    terminal by argparse, just before the session is created; from the page by
    `page_departure`, just after the service has built it. `welfare.left_cage` compares
    it with `Session.wall_now()`, so the host calendar this resolves against and the
    session's wall are one base at the departure; they could part only by an
    adjustment of the host clock in that moment. The return's `now` is the session's
    reading, for the reason `clock_or_now` gives.
