"""The session record on disk.

Written into `<root>/<YYYY-MM-DD_NN>/xcon/`, which `wl-preproc`'s frozen
path contract already reserves for us by name -- **deliberately outside `SYSTEMS`**,
because a member needs a `DONE` marker, an `AcquisitionSystem` row and a timebase
extractor, and *"an experiment controller's log carries no barcode and needs no
alignment."* So we write no marker and never block session-complete detection, and
our alignment comes entirely from the codes we strobe.

**Streamed, never accumulated.** A crash loses the tail, not the day -- the lesson
`wl-sync` learned when its own recorder held a whole session in memory and a crash
took all of it. That rules out writing Parquet as we go, since a Parquet file is only
valid once closed: JSONL is the durable record and the columnar table is derived from
it at session close, where a crash costs a conversion rather than a session.

    from wl_xcon.levels import Position

#: The session's folder: `wl_preproc.contracts.paths.XCON_DIRNAME`, copied rather than
#: imported, because nothing on a task PC imports `wl-preproc`. It was `expcontroller`
#: until 2026-09-28, when the package became wl-xcon (PI) and wl-preproc renamed its
#: constant first. `tests/test_record.py` reads theirs and fails if the two drift.
XCON_DIRNAME = "xcon"

#: How many refusal rows one session writes before it stops writing them (PI,
#: 2026-09-19), across all of its runs (b3a).
#:
#: **A bound on an untrusted peer's reach into the record, and on the write load
#: between trials.** `taskd.Session._command` records a row for every refused
#: welfare-bounded write, and nothing about that is rate-limited by a human: a
#: console looping on a rejected volume produces one per packet, each one a file
#: open, an encode and a flush -- in the inter-trial interval, where the session has
#: work to do. Unbounded, the file grows with the peer and so does the work.
#:
#: **Deliberately equal to `link.REFUSAL_HISTORY`**, and a test in `test_record.py`
#: keeps them equal. Two constants rather than an import because the durable record
#: must not depend on the console link -- the console is a view, never a source --
#: but a session that keeps fifty refusals in memory and a different number on disk
#: is two policies nobody chose.
#:
#: **The file keeps the oldest rows; the in-memory feeds keep the newest.** That is
#: the decision, not an oversight. A console answers "what is happening now". A
#: record answers "what happened", and a flood is a fault or a misbehaving console
#: while a genuine mistake appears early, when a person is typing -- so the last
#: fifty of a thousand would be exactly the rows no human wrote.
REFUSAL_LOG_LIMIT = 50

#: Operator acts on a welfare input that is not a parameter and not a refusal (PI,
#: 2026-09-20). One row per act, in the session directory.
#:
#: **Why its own file rather than one of the two beside it.** A row in
#: `parameter_changes.jsonl` carries a `sequence` whose entire purpose is to join it
#: to a `PARAM_CHANGE` escape on the recording clock -- and the out-of-cage marks are
#: deliberately *not* event-coded (PI, 2026-09-20, closing S8 open item 8), so such a
#: row would look alignable and be nothing of the kind. `refusals.jsonl` is for writes
#: that did **not** happen, is capped at `REFUSAL_LOG_LIMIT` against a flooding
#: console peer, and drops its newest rows; a confirmed or amended departure happened,
#: is one per session, and must not be droppable.
WELFARE_NOTES = "welfare_notes.jsonl"

#: A console's controls, one row each (P4d-2b spec §5.1: "every one is written to
#: the session record with who sent it and when"): a stop, a pause, a resume, a
#: mark's stamp and its note, a schedule, a cancellation, a scheduled stop firing, and
#: a manual reward given while paused, with its mL (PI, 2026-09-28).
#:
#: **Its own file**, for `WELFARE_NOTES`' reason: a row in `parameter_changes.jsonl`
#: carries a `sequence` for joining to a `PARAM_CHANGED` code, and these join to their
#: own codes (`PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `OPERATOR_MARK`, `MANUAL_REWARD`) by order and
#: instant, or to nothing.
#: **Uncapped**, unlike `refusals.jsonl`: each row is something that happened, made
#: by whoever can reach the session's link -- this machine alone, since `ZmqLink`
#: binds loopback only by default: the box's own page through `wlx serve`, or `wlx
#: console`. Marks are bounded besides at one per frame (`link.ZmqLink.mark_signal`).
#: **`wlx run --link-allow-remote` removes that premise**: any host that can reach
#: the REP port can then pause and resume the session, give manual rewards while it
#: is paused, schedule, cancel and stop, each a row here, as fast as it can send them,
#: and nothing caps this file against it.
CONTROLS = "controls.jsonl"

#: One row when each run starts and one when it ends (P4d-2b spec §6.3), joined by
#: `run`: the task, the allocation and their versions, the values and the bounded values
#: it started with, the pre-flight with who acknowledged each unknown item, and who
#: started it; then when it ended, why, and how many trials it ran. **No `unplanned`**
#: since 2026-10-01: the start row carried `unplanned: true` on every run until the PI
#: retired the unplanned run (P4d-2b spec §4.0); wl-preproc reads no such field (its
#: `main`, `b0f8b52`, read 2026-10-01).
#:
#: **`strobed` means the allocation's own codes and nothing else**: on the start row,
#: whether its `RUN_START` (4135) went out; on the end row, whether its `RUN_END` (4136)
#: did. wl-preproc's run escape opens every run, and its `RUN_END` marker closes every
#: run that ends by design, whatever `strobed` says (XC-205), so a completed run on an
#: allocation without 4135/4136 records `strobed: false` and is still framed.
#:
#: **Two rows, not the spec's one** (the b3a-1 plan, decision 4), so a run's start, and
#: the acknowledgements it started on, are on disk before its first trial: a process
#: that dies mid-run leaves the start row, and the missing end row is the signal, as a
#: missing `returned` row is for the out-of-cage interval.
RUNS = "runs.jsonl"

#: Each trial's position, written as the trial starts (XC-026 spec §8a item 1): at the
#: boundary, after its words are computed and before its first strobe, never in a frame.
#: A trial that dies mid-trial has strobed its number and has no `trials.jsonl` line,
#: so a resume takes every number from here and never issues one twice in a recording.
TRIAL_STARTS = "trial_starts.jsonl"

#: The warnings a session accepted (engine spec §19.3: "Accepted once per session, at open,
#: recorded"): one row each, when it was accepted, by whom, how -- at the open, at a run's
#: start, or by `wlx run --accept-warnings` -- in which run, and in what kind of session. Its
#: sentence is `detail`, as a load-time finding's is. Uncapped: a row is a person's act, at
#: most one per warning per session.

        not a wall clock: a wall clock here would invite someone to align a refusal to
        the neural recording, which is exactly what `parameter_change`'s `sequence`
        exists to do properly and this cannot. (It was also the clock `chair_seconds`
        and the out-of-cage ceiling read, until P4d-2a moved every welfare duration to
        the wall -- spec §10. This row stays on the frame clock: it places a refusal
        among trials, and bounds nothing.)

        No `sequence`, unlike `parameter_change`: that number exists to join a
        change to the `PARAM_CHANGE` escape on the recording clock, and a change
        that did not happen strobes nothing.

        **Bounded at `REFUSAL_LOG_LIMIT`, oldest kept** (PI, 2026-09-19). Past the
        limit this returns having touched no file at all, which is the half of the
        bound that is about the inter-trial write load rather than the file's size.
        What was dropped is counted and `close` writes one notice row for it; see
        that constant for why the oldest are the ones worth keeping.
