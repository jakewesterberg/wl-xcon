"""The trial loop: the framework executing a task's declarative data.

This is the loop S1 §5.1 keeps out of task files. A task declares states and
guarded transitions; this runs them, frame by frame, and asks a `World` whether
each non-temporal guard is satisfied. On a rig the world is hardware; in a
simulated session it is a behaviour agent; in demo mode it is a mouse and keyboard.
**They are peers** (S6 §6) -- the loop cannot tell them apart, which is what makes
a simulated session evidence about the real one.

`After` is the one guard the loop evaluates itself, from elapsed frames, because
time is the loop's own property rather than something the world reports.
