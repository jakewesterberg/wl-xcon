"""Display geometry, for both setups: direct view and the split-screen stereoscope.

**One screen at one place, two paths to it** (direct-view spec §2). The screen is fixed
50 cm from the eyes in both setups (PI, 2026-09-28); the stereoscope is a removable device
in front of it.

- **Direct view:** both eyes see the whole panel, at the screen's own distance. The field
  is the panel's, less the light sensors' housings in a bottom corner (spec §4).
- **The stereoscope:** one panel split down the middle, each eye viewing its half through a
  two-mirror periscope. The mirrors translate rather than deviate, so the *optical path* is
  the physical distance plus the lateral shift: about 63 cm, moving with each animal's eye
  spacing (`Geometry.stereoscope`). A removable mask at the panel stops the field, at ±12°
  to start.

**The panel is given by its active area, not its diagonal.** S0 §5.2's diagonal form
assumes an exact 16:9, and the rig's ASUS PG27UCDM is neither: ASUS publishes its
active area as 589.97 × 332.93 mm (1.772:1) and its diagonal as a rounded "26.5-inch
viewable". Feeding the rounded diagonal through the 16:9 fractions puts each edge
0.6-0.9% short (S0 §5.2).

**Degrees map to the panel by `D · tan`, per axis**, so the field is a rectangle in degrees
as it is in centimeters, and a housing's rectangle on the panel is a region in degrees the
same way.

Every number here is derived from `2026-08-31-stereoscope-optics-drawing.md` §3,
S0 §5.2 and the direct-view spec §2, and the tests assert the agreement. **They are
computed, not measured.** V9 measures each eye's real path per animal, because the
mirror carriage is adjustable and the two paths are equal only if the mirrors are.
