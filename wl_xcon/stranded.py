"""Sessions an animal was left out of its cage in, found after a restart, and their
returns (P4d-2b spec §6.1: "Nothing is quietly lost to a crash").

**Welfare-critical, the whole module** (`docs/design/architecture.md`). Human review
before merge.

**Found from the record alone.** A session under `--root` is stranded when its
`welfare_notes.jsonl` has a `departure` row with no `returned` row after it: a process
that died, a `wlx run` that ended with `return not recorded`, a `wlx taskd` stopped with
its session open -- each leaves exactly that. **A line that is not a row** -- a crash
mid-write -- **fails closed**, and so does a record this host cannot read as a file: the
session is stranded with its departure unknown, and
its return cannot be taken until the file is repaired by hand, since a departure nobody
can read is one no return can be checked against. **And whether it can be resumed**
(XC-026): `resume.read` is asked, and its refusal kept as `why`.

**Closed under `welfare`'s rules.** `restore` builds a `Welfare` holding only the
recorded departure (`Welfare.restore_departure`) and wraps it in a `Restored`, which
`marks.take_return` takes as it takes a `Session`: not in the future, not before the
departure, confirmed if far. **Restraint is not reconstructed**: its marks are event
codes on the recording, not rows here, and a head is not held fixed by a process that
has died, so the return is checked as a chaired session's is.
