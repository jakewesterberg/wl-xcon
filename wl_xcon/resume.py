"""A stranded session's folder read back for a resume (XC-026 spec §3, §4, §8a).

**Pure.** It reads files and returns a `Restoration`, or raises `Unresumable` saying why.
It decides nothing about welfare: `Session.resume` and `Welfare` apply what it read, and
`Service._resume` decides whether to. The departure comes in from `stranded.find`, the
one reader of `welfare_notes.jsonl`.

**Every number comes from `trial_starts.jsonl`** (§8a item 1). A trial that died mid-trial
started, and strobed its number, with no `trials.jsonl` line, so no number it took is
issued again. **The fluid comes from the lines and the hand rewards** (§4). A trial that
died has no line, so its reward, if any, is not counted, and the supplement errs larger.
A record that cannot give the fluid so far cannot be resumed: it is never taken as zero.
