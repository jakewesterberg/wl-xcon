"""The browser console's panes and page: a `Telemetry` frame in, HTML out.

P4d-2b slice b1 (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-P4d2b-browser-console-design.md`
§1, §4.2). **Pure** -- no socket, no clock, no thread. `wlx serve` reads the clock and
the stream and hands them in as a `View`, so every pane is tested the way `cli.render`
is: "fluid session and the supplement are never dropped" is an assertion on this
module's output (spec §4.4), not a hope about a browser.

**Every telemetry string reaches the page through `_e`** (`html.escape`, quotes
included), in elements and attributes alike. A task path, a condition, a refusal's
reason and an actor's typed name are text a person or a peer chose.

**Every number is read from the frame**, as `cli.render`'s are, with the arithmetic a
display needs and no more: the strip's correct counts, which add `correct_reject` to
`correct` -- the one rollup, ruled for the strip alone (PI, 2026-09-26, spec §3) -- and
their percentages, the fluid bar's width, the deadline back to the cage (the frame's
instant less the time out, plus the limit: the session-levels plan, ruling 5), and the
time since the last reward -- the frame's own instant less the reward's, both on the
session's anchored clock, plus how long `wlx serve` has held the frame on its steady
clock (`View.frame_age_s`; ledger Ruling 1, 2026-09-27). No host clock is read against
a session instant. Trials per minute is derived by `wlx serve`, never here.

**Unknown is a word, never 0**: a day nobody measured, a reward not given yet, a
configuration nobody named, and the three *Wrong?* measurements nothing takes yet. A
rate not derived yet is left off the strip, as mockup v13 leaves it, never `0.0/min`.

**The strip carries two cells** (session-levels spec §6, amending P4d-2b spec §4.0):
fluid today against its floor, with the supplement, the last reward and back to cage
beneath it; and correct over trials for the session, its task, this run and this
block. Fluid session is on Runtime and End of session, and the supplement on both as
well as the strip, where **both are on the page in every state**: the zero-reward
ruling (S9a §9) rests on their being visible.

#: **The page's whole script, and all it does** (spec §4.3, §4.4, and since P4d-2b
#: b2a §5.2): open the event stream, swap each fragment into the element with its id,
#: run the stale timer while more frames are due, close the stream on the ✕, and
#: reconnect -- and, from b2a, send the controls as JSON `POST`s to `/commands`,
#: debounce the parameter arrows, handle the **P** and **M** keys, and ask for the
#: operator's name. `EventSource` reconnects on its own after a dropped connection,
#: and `wlx serve` sends a full render first on every new stream, so a reconnect
#: re-renders in full. **It still renders nothing itself**: every `innerHTML` it
#: writes is a fragment `wlx serve` rendered, and what it writes of its own -- the
#: name and the last command's answer -- goes in as `textContent`.
#:
#: **The stale timer runs from the frame's age, not from an event's arrival**
#: (Ruling 12, 2026-09-27). Every event carries `age`, the seconds `wlx serve` has
#: held the latest frame; the baseline is the arrival less that, and the stream is
#: stale once `now - baseline` reaches `--stale-after` -- `>=`, so the page agrees
#: with `/health`'s own boundary -- with that interval as the banner's N. A `null`
#: age -- no frame yet -- runs no timer. It shares with `/health` *when* frames are
#: due (`live`, `health.expects_frames`), not the clock: this one is the page's own
#: `performance.now()`, monotonic so a browser clock step never skews it, carried
#: from `wlx serve`'s steady clock by `age`.
#:
#: **A lost stream is greyed as a stale one is** (m3): the timer stands down while
#: the stream is lost, so without this a red *stream lost* banner sat over
#: full-color numbers nothing was updating. The next frame's `check()` clears it.
#:
#: **The controls (P4d-2b b2a).** The box's own page may write (`data-can-write` on
#: `<body>`, from `View.can_write`), and since b2b so may the rig's https page while a
#: wl.works member is signed in there (`data-signin`, the sign-in's block below);
#: everywhere else every control is disabled in the HTML and `post` sends nothing. The
#: name is asked once, kept in `localStorage` -- inside `try`, since a private window
#: may refuse it -- and a prompt refused or cleared sends nothing. An arrow steps its
#: input and the change is sent `debounceMs` after the last click; while an input has
#: focus or a change is pending, a new parameters fragment is held and swapped in
#: afterwards, so a frame never replaces an input under a person's hands. P and M do
#: nothing in a text box or when held. A mark sends its signal at once with
#: `pressed_at` -- the browser's clock, and the only `Date.now()` outside the sign-in's
#: block, which reads it for its tokens' expiry -- then opens the note box: Enter
#: attaches the note, Esc leaves the mark bare, and a second mark leaves the first bare.
#:
#: **Sessions from the page (P4d-2b b3a-2).** Choosing a task between runs, or pressing the
#: pre-flight pill, takes the pre-flight (`check`); *start run* sends the task of the
#: pre-flight shown, the trial count and the unknown items ticked, then clears the ticks;
#: *new session* sends the dialog's fields as typed, and they are cleared once the page
#: shows that session open (the b3a-2 final review, I1); *end session* sends the return typed, or
#: none for later; a warning's *confirm* or *amend* re-sends the open or the return this
#: page sent, with its answer, and a warning this page did not raise is not answered.
#: A swap keeps a select's chosen option and the ticks. It still renders nothing itself.

    """The whole document, every pane already rendered into it, so it reads before
    its stream has opened (spec §4.3).

    `parts` is `fragments(...)`; each fills the element whose id is its key, the id
    the stream's events swap by. A missing key raises `KeyError`: a page with a pane
    left blank is a bug to see, not a page to serve. `nonce` is the one in the
    Content-Security-Policy `wlx serve` sends with this response; the one script
    carries it. `stale_after_s` goes to the script as `data-stale-after`.

    **The controls (P4d-2b b2a, spec §5.2)**: the control bar's buttons are the
    `controls` fragment, and around it are the parts no frame changes -- the name,
    the last command's answer, the stop confirm, the mark's note box and the
    scheduled-stop form -- static, so a frame never replaces what a person is typing.
    `can_write` is `View.can_write` for the browser this page is for: `False`
    disables those static controls here and tells the script (`data-can-write`); the
    fragments grey their own. Close and reconnect, and the tab radios, are b1's.
    **The session forms (P4d-2b b3a-2)**: the *New session* dialog, the end
    confirmation, the return and the amendment are static too, and so is the run's
    trial count; only the task and subject selects' options are fragments (the b3a-2
    plan, decision 11).
    **The https page (b2b spec §4)**: with `signin`, the static controls carry `disabled
    data-signin` for the script to enable, the name is replaced by the sign-in and sign-out
    buttons, and the sign-in's addresses ride on `<body>`. `https_page` is for the plain-http
    page of a rig that has one: a LAN viewer's greyed controls say where else they work.
    `https_off` is why the rig's https page is off (b2b-ready §3.1), shown on the box's own
    page only.
