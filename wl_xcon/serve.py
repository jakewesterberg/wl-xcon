"""`wlx serve` -- the browser console's process (P4d-2b slices b1, b2a, b3a-2 and b2b).

Specs: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-P4d2b-browser-console-design.md` §1-§5, and for
the rig's https page `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin-design.md`.

**Its own process, beside `taskd` and never inside it** (S9a §7: the hot loop never
serves a request). It holds one `link.ZmqConsole`, keeps the latest frame, and serves
three things over the stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer` -- the stack wl-preproc's responder
already runs, so no new dependency:

- `GET /` -- the page, every pane rendered in Python (`web.py`).
- `GET /events` -- server-sent events: one full render on connect, then the fragments
  that changed, once per frame this browser keeps up with and once per keepalive
  interval between frames, each re-rendered from a fresh snapshot. Every event
  carries `live` and `age` -- how long this process has held the latest frame, `null`
  before any -- which the page's stale timer runs on (Ruling 12, 2026-09-27).
- `GET /health` -- `health.py`'s body for wl-works, behind a bearer token.

- `POST /commands` (P4d-2b b2a, spec §5.3) -- one JSON command, validated before
  anything is queued (`parse_command`) and answered *sent*, *not delivered* or *busy*,
  the truth about delivery. On the plain-http listener it comes from the box's own page,
  under spec §2's four checks, and a command carrying a token is refused there. Since
  P4d-2b b3a-2 it also takes `wlx taskd`'s own four -- `open`, `check`, `start`, `end`
  -- built by the wire's own rules (`link._command_from`).

**The rig's https page (b2b, `--https` and its five companion flags).** A second
listener, TLS, serves the same routes plus `POST /whoami` and `POST /signout`. A command
there is accepted from this rig's page (`Origin`, `Content-Type`) with a wl.works
member's token that `signin.Checker` accepts, offline, and is sent as that member's.
Without the flags there is no second listener and `signin` is never imported.

Everything else is 404 or 405, as JSON, never the stdlib's HTML page. **Every request
is answered only when its `Host` names this console** (spec §2, §5.3): on the plain-http
listener, loopback, the box's own names and addresses, and `--allow-host` names
(`box_names`); on the https listener, the rig page's own host, exactly. Anything else
gets a JSON 421 and no page, which closes DNS rebinding on the LAN-open reads too.

**Restarting it changes nothing in `taskd`** (spec §2): it reads the PUB socket, and
what it sends is acknowledged or said not to be; a pause, a schedule and every
setting are held by `taskd`, not here.

**Threads, and what each owns** (spec §2: each ZMQ socket has one owning thread).
The telemetry thread (`Server._listen`) owns a read-only `ZmqConsole`, its SUB
socket. The command thread (an `Outbox`) owns a `ZmqCommands`, the REQ socket, and
takes commands from a bounded queue. The mark thread (another `Outbox`) owns a
`ZmqMarks`, the PUSH socket to the session's mark endpoint, so a mark's signal goes
ahead of any command waiting on the rig's acknowledgment (spec §5.3). Each browser's
`/events` and each `POST` runs on the HTTP server's thread for that connection. With
`--https`, the https listener has a thread of its own, and each of its connections does
its TLS handshake on that connection's thread (`_PageServer`); while wl.works' keys have
not been read, the keys thread (`signin.Checker.retry_until_ready`) tries again every
`signin.RETRY_EVERY_S`, and ends once it has them.

**No timing claim is made here.** `DEFAULT_STALE_AFTER_S` is a display choice (spec
§3); `QUEUE_DEPTH`, `RATE_SAMPLE_S`, `KEEPALIVE_S`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S`, `RETRY_MS`,
`COMMAND_QUEUE_DEPTH`, `MARK_QUEUE_DEPTH`, `BODY_LIMIT`, `MARKS_REMEMBERED`,
`OUTBOX_POLL_S` and the link's `REPLY_TIMEOUT_S` and `CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S` are
housekeeping, not a measurement of this system.

    subscribers; each queue is thread-safe on its own.

    **`offer` and `reject` assume one producer thread**, `Server._listen`, and are
    not safe to call from two at once: each copies the table of subscribers under the
    lock and pushes to the copy after releasing it. A `close()` that lands between
    the copy and the push can therefore leave one stale frame queued behind a

    a real clock. **There is no wall clock here**: this process's host clock parts from
