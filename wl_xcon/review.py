"""What a human reviews instead of source.

ADR-0006's acceptance test: a task Claude wrote is approved from a rendered state
diagram, a table of every event code with the state that emits it, the declared
parameters with their ranges, and a simulation report. **If a task cannot be
reviewed from these, the design failed rather than the reviewer.**

The diagram is Mermaid, so it renders in the repository, in a pull request, and in
anything the lab already reads -- rather than needing a viewer nobody has installed
