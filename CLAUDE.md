# Working conventions — wl-xcon

These conventions bind every session (human- or AI-driven) working in this repo.

## Read order before touching code
1. `docs/CHECKPOINT.md` — where the build is, which package you are in, and what to
   read. **It tells you to read a small number of documents. Believe it.** Reading
   all 24 is how a session runs out of context before producing anything.
2. `docs/M0-REVIEW.md` §3–§4 — what is still open, and the engineering calls made
   without asking
3. `docs/design/architecture.md` — topology, contracts, latency budgets
4. `docs/pitfalls.md` — the failure modes we are designing against
5. Relevant ADRs in `docs/design/decisions/`, then the S-spec you are working in
   (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-spec-map.md` says which)

## Rules
- **US English** everywhere (code, docs, comments).
- **No timing claim without a measurement.** Never state or document a latency,
  jitter, or throughput number for this system unless it comes from a script in
  `tools/` (once code exists) with results committed under `docs/measurements/`.
  Literature numbers are cited with source and date.
- **Sim first.** New functionality ships with a simulator-backed test. Nothing merges
  with a red test suite. Hardware-specific code lives behind the interfaces defined
  in `docs/design/architecture.md`.
- **Hot-path discipline.** Inside trial loops: no allocation, no logging I/O, no
  unbounded work per frame. GC is explicitly managed around trials, never during.
- **Welfare-critical code requires human review.** Anything touching reward delivery
  amounts/limits, session duration or fluid tracking, or stimulation triggering must
  be reviewed by a human lab member before merge. Keep these modules small and listed
  in `docs/design/architecture.md`.
- **ADRs for irreversible choices.** Engine, transport, file-format, and license
  decisions go through `docs/design/decisions/` using the template.
- **Dependency policy.** New dependencies need a one-line justification and a license
  entry in ADR-0004's inventory. Prefer boring, maintained libraries.
- **Docs stay in sync.** A change that invalidates architecture.md, pitfalls.md, or
  the roadmap updates them in the same commit.
- **No fabrication.** If a fact about external software matters (API behavior,
  license, latency), verify against the primary source and cite it with an as-of
  date, or mark it UNVERIFIED.
- **Cite the library for science-facing choices.** A choice that rests on the literature
  names its papers by key from `docs/references/library.bib` and has an entry in
  `docs/references/decisions.md`; one that rests on an institutional rule, a PI's decision
  or an engineering default says so there instead. wl-xtasks cites the same library.
- **Read the neighbouring repository's source before specifying against it.** Not its
  README, not its manifest. This session found the event codec already frozen in
  `wl-preproc` after `wl-exptasks`' manifest said nothing was allocated, found
  `expcontroller/` already reserved for us by name, and found the eye-calibration
  model already fixed — each time while about to design a second one. `wlo validate`
  cannot catch this class of error: it checks that a published name resolves to one
  publisher, never that the description is true.
- **Registry over README for lifecycle.** A package's stage is what
  `wl-orchestrator/registry/` says. `wl-elab`'s own README still reads as the live ELN
  and the registry has said `deprecated` for some time.
- **Ask, do not file.** A decision that is science-facing, animal-facing, or expensive
  to get wrong goes to the PI as a question at the moment it arises. Recording it in an
  open-items table is a record, not an ask — and three of the first four decisions
  revisited that way were changed.
- **What is open lives in `docs/backlog.md`, one line per item.** An item goes in the
  moment it is deferred, by whoever defers it; closing one removes its line in the
  commit that does the work ("closes XC-017"). A PI decision is asked, never filed there.

- **Leave the repo resumable.** A session ends by updating `docs/CHECKPOINT.md`:
  what moved, what is next, and anything learned that would cost the next session
  something to rediscover. A checkpoint that has gone stale is worse than none,
  because it is believed.
- **Prove a test can fail.** `python3 tools/mutate.py --all <module>` before trusting
  a new check. CI gates on it. A test that cannot fail reports safety it does not
  provide, and for a checker whose whole job is refusing bad tasks that is worse than
  having no checker. **Read the harness's output, not its exit code** — it has been
  wrong seven times, most recently reporting `caught` on `calibration.recenter` for
  as long as that function existed — it had inserted the mutation into the parameter
  list, so the `SyntaxError` was doing the reporting. `N failed` is a test noticing;
  `N errors in 0.8s` is not. **A tool that reasons about code asks the parser**: three
  of those seven were one regex, and each fix created the next. And never run the
  suite, edit a test, or `git add` while a sweep is in flight: the module on disk is
  neutered and the suite it is measuring must not move.
- **A safety component ships with its consumer, or its absence fails.** Writing the
  guardrail and wiring it later is how `bounds`' fluid check went a week called by
  nothing, and how `Mark` and `Reward` were silently dropped by the trial loop while
  1,000-trial sessions reported clean. If the consumer cannot exist yet, make the
  missing wiring *raise* — `dio.Absent`, `welfare.Absent` and `run.Unwired` all refuse
  rather than quietly doing nothing. And **test the path, not the piece**: every link of
  that chain was individually tested while the chain was broken.
- **A "not yet" comment is a dated claim about the rest of the repo**, and it is the one
  kind of claim no test can check. Name what it is waiting for, so the next reader can
  grep it instead of believing it.

## Commit style
Imperative subject line; body explains why when non-obvious. The repo history is part
of the lab record.
