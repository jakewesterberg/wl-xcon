# S9a — The experimenter console

- **Status:** proposed, for PI review
- **Date:** 2026-08-31
- **Parent:** S9; ADR-0002

---

## 1. Shape, settled

**Superseded 2026-09-19 by ADR-0008: a web application served by each control box.**
Three things changed — the kiosk became real and an iPad cannot run Qt; `labhost` and
`wl-works`' Plan 10 responder put an HTTP server on the box by design anyway, so "a
server on the rig" no longer distinguishes the options; and `wl-works` already specifies
the device directory. The replica pane (§2) is the one part not settled by that ADR: it
is gated on **protocol V11**, a measurement, not on anyone's view of browsers.

What this section said, kept because it is the argument the ADR had to answer:
*"**A desktop application: PySide6 with PyQtGraph** (PI, 2026-08-31). Qt because the live
plots need PyQtGraph and PyQtGraph is Qt; desktop because plots at trial rates are a
stated requirement and a browser would put an HTTP server on a machine whose whole job
is frame-accurate timing."*

**`taskd` owns the session; consoles attach.** A session survives the console closing,
crashing, or sitting on a laptop whose lid shuts over a working animal. Several consoles
may attach at once. That is also what makes the *remote* console real rather than a
viewer — S9 §7's remote operation is this decision, not a feature.

> **Amended 2026-09-19.** This said "one holds the write lock". There is no write lock:
> anybody attached has full access, because `bounds` is the welfare boundary and a lock
> would only buy coordination — at the price of an animal waiting on a sleeping laptop.
> §8 has what replaces it.

## 2. The experimenter screen is a replica, not a dashboard widget

MonkeyLogic's Graphics Library draws **two parallel screens**: the subject's, and an
exact replica scaled to the experimenter's, carrying *"additional information for the
experimenter, such as online states of input signals, fixation windows and custom user
strings"* ([Hwang et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31071345/)).

**Take this wholesale.** The experimenter sees what the animal sees, with the invisible
things drawn on top: gaze, the windows, joystick position, which stimulus is up. A
separate "eye tracking depiction" widget beside a stimulus preview would be two things a
person has to correlate by eye, several times a minute, forever.

### 2.1 What a stereoscope does to that idea

The subject sees two viewports through mirrors; the replica cannot simply mirror one
screen. Proposed: **draw the cyclopean view** — the task's own coordinate frame — with
disparity shown as an annotation rather than as two panels, and gaze drawn per eye so
vergence is visible. A two-panel replica would be literal and would make the experimenter
do the fusing, which is the animal's job and not theirs.

**Open:** whether a dichoptic trial (different content per eye, S1a §4.1) needs a
two-panel mode after all. It is the one case a cyclopean replica genuinely cannot show.

### 2.2 Calibration by clicking

ML puts targets on the subject screen by clicking the corresponding place on the control
screen. Adopt it: the replica is already in task coordinates, so clicking it *is* naming
a position in degrees. The calibration grid (S5 §7, a 3×3 — never a ring) is then a
sequence of clicks or one button, and drift correction is a click where the animal is
actually looking.

---

## 3. Information density is the requirement, not a risk

The PI's words: *"it is information dense."* A rig console is read at a glance, many
times an hour, by someone doing three other things. Sparse is not calm here; it is a
person opening panels to find out whether an animal is working.

Everything below is visible without clicking. Four groups, ranked by what a glance is
for:

| Group | Carries |
|---|---|
| **Animal** | Fluid against the day's **floor** (PI, 2026-09-06 — not a ceiling), reconciled (P17) not tallied; **time out of the cage** against its ceiling, which is the one limit that ends a session; chair time beside it, recorded and bounding nothing (PI, 2026-09-19) |
| **Working?** | Running / paused / fault, trials attempted / completed / correct, recent performance |
| **Wrong?** | Abort reasons, dropped frames from the flip patch, tracker staleness, RHX backpressure margin |
| **Still needed** | Per-condition achieved against target — the question actually asked at a rig |

Plus, from the PI and not in S9: **configuration information** (which task, which
allocation, which bounded config, which stimulus calibration, display mode), **task
selection**, and the replica of §2.

The parameter row is **generated from the task's declaration** (S8 §3.1) — typed widgets,
range limits, validation, staged application. No per-task UI code, which is what makes it
work for a task nobody hand-wrote.

---

## 5. The Python ceiling, found by installing it

**PsychoPy 2026.2.3 declares `>=3.10,<3.13`. Python 3.13 cannot run the display layer.**

Nothing in this repository or `wl-preproc`'s said so. Three consequences:

1. `wl.yaml`'s Python constraint is now `>=3.11,<3.13`.
2. Fedora ships 3.13, but **this is a provisioning detail, not an incompatibility** —
   `dnf install python3.12` and the rig uses that. Corrected 2026-08-31; an earlier
   version of this section overstated it.
3. **It does not add a reason to prefer Ubuntu.** S0's choice rests on NI-DAQmx, which
   is an out-of-tree kernel module against unsupported distributions and is not fixed by
   installing another Python. One reason, not two.

**And it is an argument against PsychoPy rather than for a Python version** — ADR-0002
is reopened on it, among other things.

CI keeps a 3.13 leg **deliberately**, testing the core — schema, checks, encoder, runner,
record — which has no display dependency and must not acquire one. If a 3.13 job ever
fails on an import, something has leaked through `DisplayAdapter`, and that is worth
failing over.

## 6. Identity and authority

Settled 2026-09-19, after ADR-0008. **The box is the authority**, because `wl-works`
deliberately will not be: its Plan 10 §4.1 is the first line of its protocol document —
*"Publishing an action makes it available to every member of the lab. There is no
permission model on the app side."* On a preprocessing server the worst case is wasted
compute; on a rig it is fluid, or a session started on an animal nobody is standing next
to.

**The box is an OAuth2 client of `wl-works`.** Not a bespoke scheme: read from their
source 2026-09-19, `src/lib/auth.ts` registers better-auth's `mcp()` plugin, which *is*
the OAuth provider in 1.7.1 and serves the `/oauth2/*` surface Zulip already consumes,
with per-client PKCE. Revocation is proven end to end there — an admin deactivating a
member cut their already-open Zulip session as a direct result. So the ask on `wl-works`
is to register a client, not to build token issuance.

**Two entry points, one console.** The same page, reached two ways, because two UIs would
be the two-operator-surfaces mistake ADR-0008 exists to avoid:

- **Via `wl-works`** — sign in there, land on the box, the box verifies the token. Actions
  are attributed to a real account, and deactivating that account revokes access to every
  box at once.
- **Locally** — straight to the box, authenticated by the box's own credential. Always
  works, never touches the network. **A permanent peer, not an emergency hatch** (PI,
  2026-09-19), so that a `wl-works` outage cannot cost an operator the console with an
  animal in the chair.

**`Actor` is two types, not one type with a nullable name.** `Verified(person, issuer,
token id)` and `Local(box credential)`. Different types for the reason `Floor` and
`Ceiling` are different types: so no call site can treat them alike, and so "we do not
know who" can never render as a name. A forgeable name is worse than no name, because it
is believed.

*Built 2026-10-02 (b2b slice 1) as `actor.Box` and `actor.Member`; `Local(box credential)`
became `Box(name)`, a name typed at the rig PC, since the box has no credential of its own
beyond being the rig PC.*

*Built 2026-10-05 (b2b slice 2): the box is not an OAuth client holding a session; the
browser holds the member's token and `wlx serve` checks it offline, as the P4d-2b spec
§5.7 recorded the PI choosing on 2026-09-27.*

**The degradation is loud.** The console header states its mode. Every welfare-affecting
action records its actor type, and a session whose welfare actions were unattributed says
so in its summary. The local path is not prevented — preventing it defeats its purpose —
it is made impossible not to notice.

**Token expiry mid-session interrupts nothing.** The session continues, the console drops
to local mode, and the transition is recorded as an event. Never raise out of a trial the
animal is completing, which is the rule `welfare.Rig` already follows for pump faults.

                      └ /health  (the labhost surface)
```

**HTTP and server-sent events, not WebSockets** (P4d-2b spec §1, PI 2026-09-26). Panes are
rendered to HTML in Python and pushed as fragments, so what a pane may never drop is a pytest
assertion on the renderer. WebSockets are deferred to the replica pane, if V11 shows a browser
can carry it at display rate — an added endpoint for one pane, not a rewrite. Known limit,
accepted: when not served over HTTP/2, a browser holds at most six server-sent-event
connections per browser and domain, and both Chrome and Firefox have marked that "Won't fix"
(MDN, "Using server-sent events", read 2026-09-27, page last modified 2026-09-03). `wlx serve`
speaks HTTP/1.0, so the limit applies: a seventh console tab on one box in one browser stalls.

**Writes from the box, and one socket per thread** (P4d-2b spec §2, §5.3; built in slice
b2a, 2026-09-28). `POST /commands` is accepted only from the box's own page — a loopback
peer, a `Host` naming loopback, the page's `Origin`, JSON — and every request is answered
only when its `Host` names this console. The console's telemetry thread reads, its command
thread alone owns the REQ socket and tells the page *sent* only when `taskd` has
acknowledged, and its mark thread sends an operator's mark on a third socket, ahead of
every command, for `taskd` to stamp in the frame it arrives.

**Queued commands reach the rig one trial boundary apart** (found by the b2a final
review's probe, 2026-09-28). The command thread sends one command and waits for
`taskd`'s acknowledgment before it sends the next, and `taskd` reads its REP socket once
per trial boundary — once per housekeeping pass while paused — so a command queued
behind another reaches the rig, in practice, at the boundary after the one ahead of it.
Up to `COMMAND_QUEUE_DEPTH` (4) wait behind the one in flight, and a further one is
answered *busy*. So a stop posted behind queued settings or schedules takes effect that
many trials late: in the probe, three schedules and a stop posted together landed at
trials 17, 18, 19 and 20. So the stop's confirm step says *stop at a trial boundary,
after any commands already sent?* (`c0d0ba4`). It said *stop at the next trial
boundary?*, which was exact only when nothing was queued ahead of it. Marks are not in
this queue. Delivering what is queued at a single boundary, and letting a stop go ahead
of it, are left to b2b (XC-121).

**A deployment note on the `Host` check.** `wlx serve` finds the box's own names by
resolving its host names, not by listing its network interfaces, so on a box whose
`/etc/hosts` maps its hostname to `127.0.1.1` (Debian's default) its LAN address is
missing and LAN viewers — and wl-works' `/health` poll by IP — get 421 until the console
is started with `--allow-host <that address>`.

**Two processes, and the split was already mandatory.** §1 of S9: *"`taskd` and `console`
are separate processes under all conditions. The hot loop never renders a plot, serves a
request, or holds a UI."* An HTTP server inside `taskd` is out on that rule alone.

**ADR-0003's link is untouched** — REQ/REP for commands, PUB for telemetry, msgpack,
schema-versioned. The console is a new client of an existing contract, not a new
transport.

**The console can die without the experiment noticing.** It holds HTTP sessions, OAuth
state and a cache of the last telemetry so a newly-opened browser renders immediately. It
holds no authoritative session state. Restart it mid-session and nothing in the trial loop
changes, which is the property §1 asks for when it says a session survives the console
closing.

**Identity crosses one trust boundary and it is explicit.** `wl-works` asserts identity to
the box, signed. Inside the box the console asserts the actor to `taskd` over ZMQ and
`taskd` trusts it, because they are the same machine and the console *is* the
authenticator. Command messages therefore carry an `actor`, and the audit is written by
`taskd`, where the validated write path already lives.

**"The same machine" is now enforced at the bind, not just asserted here.** Added
2026-09-19. `ZmqLink` binds loopback only; a wildcard, a LAN address, or anything it
cannot classify is refused, and `wlx run --link-allow-remote` (`allow_remote=True`) is how
an operator says a reachable bind was meant. Until P4d-3 builds §6's `Actor`, a command's
`by` is whatever the sender typed, so a reachable REP port means any host on the lab
network can, under an invented name, change a setting (a reward volume among them), pause
and resume a session, give manual rewards while it is paused, schedule or cancel a stop,
or stop it — and since P4d-2b b2a, a reachable mark port lets it put marks on the record.
The paragraph above is the *whole* of the authentication, and a bind that leaves the
machine voids it.
`ZmqConsole` is not restricted the same way: it connects, and where a console looks is its
own operator's decision.

**`labhost` stops being its own component.** P4c's pull-only `/health` endpoint becomes a
surface of the console process rather than a second server on the box: same process,
separate path, separate auth, since `wl-preproc`'s lab-host protocol carries its own
bearer token and deliberately no permission model.

**The subject's display is not affected by any of this.** S13 §3 routes the kiosk through
the display module's zero-disparity path, so `DisplayAdapter` is unchanged and ADR-0002
stays deferred. The console is an operator surface only.

---

## 8. Writers: visibility instead of a lock

Settled 2026-09-19 (PI): *"anybody connecting to the session should be able to access
features full access."* **There is no write lock.** S9 §10's open item 1 — arbitration
between console and control-API writers — resolves by dissolving: both are ordinary
writers.

**This is safe because `bounds` is the welfare boundary, not the lock.** Two writers
cannot do harm concurrently: a per-delivery magnitude is ceiling-checked whoever asks,
fluid is a floor with no ceiling to race against, mappings are versioned, and stop is
idempotent. Concurrent writers cause *confusion*, not damage — and confusion is cheaper to
solve with visibility than with a lock that makes an animal wait while somebody's laptop
is asleep.

Three things replace it:

- **Presence.** Every console shows who else is attached.
- **A live change feed.** Every parameter change, reward and state transition appears on
  every attached console with its actor.
- **Staged changes are visible to everyone, not only to whoever staged them.** This is the
  one that carries the weight. With no lock, the only thing standing between a change and
  an invisible parameter move is that everybody can see it.

Last-write-wins within an ITI, both writes recorded with their actors, and the resolution
shown.

**Since P4d-2b b2a (2026-09-28) the feed is on the page**, rendered in Python like every
pane: staged changes, then the control events — each setting applied, each pause and
resume, each mark and its note, each schedule and cancellation, and each manual reward
given while paused — newest first with when
and who, then the refusals. The session keeps the last `link.CONTROL_HISTORY` of those
events for the feed and counts what fell off (`controls_dropped`); `controls.jsonl` in the
session record keeps every one.

**"Staged" means one thing: validated, and not yet applied** (PI, 2026-09-19). A change of
either kind — an ordinary task parameter or a welfare-bounded value such as
`reward_correct` — is refused or accepted at the moment it is offered, and applied at the
next trial boundary by `taskd.Session._apply_staged`, with the `PARAM_CHANGED` strobe and
the `parameter_changes.jsonl` row written in that same pass. The trial running when a
change is staged uses the old value, whichever kind it is. §8.1 recorded the period when
that was true of only one of the two kinds, and why it stopped being.

### 8.1 A welfare-bounded change used to apply immediately, and no longer does

**Decided 2026-09-19 (PI): a welfare-bounded change defers, like an ordinary parameter.**
This section is kept because the reason is worth grepping, not because anything here is
still live.

`Session.set` called `bounds.set` synchronously as the command was drained, and
`welfare.Rig.deliver` reads `bounds.value(ref)` at the moment it opens the valve — so the
trial that ran later in that same pass was already at the new volume, while `link.Staged`
published it as `staged` and the `PARAM_CHANGED` strobe and `parameter_changes.jsonl` row
landed a pass later still. Measured on `p4d1-console-link` with a six-trial session and one
queued `SetParameter(reward_correct, 0.30)` against a starting 0.15: trial 0 commanded
0.30 mL, and its record row was written between trial 0 and trial 1.

The ceiling held on every path and nothing landed mid-trial, so this was never
over-delivery. It was **fluid attribution off by one trial**: anyone reconciling commanded
fluid against `parameter_changes.jsonl` offline assigned one trial's delivery to the wrong
value.

**What replaced it.** `bounds.Bounds.validate` now answers "would this be refused" without
moving anything, `Session.set` validates at offer time and stages, and
`Session._apply_staged` performs the assignment — so the value, the strobe and the record
row all move in the same pass, immediately before the first trial they describe. The cost
the PI weighed and accepted: an operator who has just lowered a reward volume watches one
more trial go out at the old one.

---

## 9. The telemetry contract

**One rule: every number on the console comes from the object the record is written from,
never computed beside it.** This is where a number nobody measured would get in, and the
defence is structural rather than careful.

| Pane | Source |
|---|---|
| Fluid delivered / floor / supplement | `welfare.session_total`, `total_today`, `shortfall()`, `bounds.minima`. **These two are welfare-load-bearing and may not be dropped or folded away** — see below |
| Time out of cage | `welfare.out_of_cage_seconds` — read on the wall clock like the ceiling that ends the session, so the two match (P4d-2a spec §10; frame-derived, for the same reason, until then). `None`, rendered *cage-side, the animal is home*, for a deployment with no duration bound (S13 §4.0) |
| Chair time | `welfare.chair_seconds` — shown beside it, and **not** what ends the session since 2026-09-19. Showing only this one meant an operator would watch a session stop on a clock the console never displayed. **`None` for `RIG_CHAIRED` and `CAGE_SIDE`** (PI, 2026-09-20), rendered as *n/a* with the reason — never `0:00`, which on a chaired animal would report restraint nothing measured |
| Deployment | `Telemetry.deployment` — which of the three kinds this session declared. On the wire rather than derived, because two kinds share one `None` for chair time and this pane names fields rather than inferring them |
| Time left out of the cage | `welfare.approaching_limit` as a `WARNING:` line beside the stop reason, once the ceiling is within `warn_within` (PI, 2026-09-20). Silent otherwise, and silent again past the limit, where the stop reason speaks. **After the loop, past the limit, it carries `welfare.must_stop`'s sentence** (P4d-2a, `taskd.Session.duration_warning`): there is no loop left to stop, and the warning is what says the animal is still out |
| Phase | `Telemetry.phase` (schema 6, P4d-2a): `running` while the loop runs, including the frame that announces its stop; `awaiting_return` while a rig session's out-of-cage clock stays open after the loop (`taskd.Session.await_return`); `closed` once the return is recorded. A cage-side session never leaves `running` on the wire. Set by `taskd`, never inferred by the console |
| Why it stopped | `Telemetry.stop_kind` (schema 6, P4d-2a): `completed`, `operator`, `limit` or `fault`, and `None` while running, set at each of `taskd`'s five stop sites, and to `fault` by a fault in `await_return` after the loop. The fifth site is `run()`'s own `KeyboardInterrupt` handler: Ctrl-C at `wlx run`'s terminal sets `operator`, as a console's `Stop` does. `stopped_because` keeps the sentence; this is the kind, so nothing parses the sentence to tell a pump fault from a clean finish |
| In session | `Telemetry.in_session_seconds` (schema 6, P4d-2a spec §10 item 3): the session opened to the session ended, on the wall, from `taskd.Session.opened_wall_at`/`ended_wall_at`. `None` before the session opens, never `0.0`. **It bounds nothing** (PI, 2026-09-26: *"only shown and recorded"*): `welfare` never sees it, and it has no warning line |
| Trials, outcomes, aborts by reason | `simulate.Tally`, already shared with `taskd` |
| Still needed, by condition | `scheduler` quotas |
| Configuration: task, allocation, bounded config | `SessionSpec.task`, `.allocation`, `.bounds_config` — what the config snapshot's `versions` records. Display mode and stimulus calibration have no source yet and say so |
| The day's floor; the out-of-cage limit | `welfare.bounds.minima[DAILY_FLUID]` and `ceilings[OUT_OF_CAGE].value` — the numbers `shortfall` and `must_stop` read. The limit is `None` cage-side |
| Time since the last reward | `Telemetry.wall_at` less `Telemetry.last_reward_at` (`welfare.last_delivery_wall_at`) — the frame's own instant and the reward's, both on the session's `SessionClock` — plus the seconds `wlx serve` has held the frame on its steady clock (ledger Ruling 1, 2026-09-27). No host clock is subtracted from a session instant, so a step of the host clock moves nothing. **What keeps a working, unpaid animal visible on the strip** since 2026-09-26: fluid today standing still while this grows |
| Recent outcomes | `Session.recent_outcomes` — the last 60 strings `trials.jsonl` records, from the one string both are handed |
| Correct / trials, on the strip | `Telemetry.outcomes["correct"]` plus `["correct_reject"]`, over `trial_index`: **the one rollup, ruled for the strip only** (PI, 2026-09-26: both are the right answer on their trial). The Working? pane and `/health` count every outcome as it occurred |
| Parameter row | `Session.parameters` → `Telemetry.params`: the task's own `Param` declarations with their values, then the welfare ceilings a console may stage; writes return through `Session.set` |
| Trials per minute | **Derived by `wlx serve`**, from `trial_index` over the last five minutes of frames, labeled derived on the page, bounding nothing — the one console number not in the record, and it says so |
| Paused, and since when | `Session.paused_at` → `Telemetry.paused_at` (schema 8), the instant on the session's anchored clock, `None` while trials run. Set at the boundary a `Pause` was drained at; the pill says *paused · since HH:MM:SS* only while the session runs |
| Scheduled stop | `Session.scheduled_stop` → `Telemetry.scheduled_stop` (kind, target, who, and `said`, the rig's own words, which the stop reason reuses). Shown on the strip while it is held, with a cancel button; spent when it fires |
| Changes feed: control events | `Session.controls` → `Telemetry.controls` and `controls_dropped` (schema 8): the last 50 stops, pauses, resumes, marks, notes, schedules, cancellations, manual rewards and applied settings, with who and when. The record (`controls.jsonl`, and `parameter_changes.jsonl` for settings) keeps all of them |
| Drops, staleness | `eye`'s staleness accounting |

**If the console needs a number that is not in those objects, the fix is to add it to the
object.** A console-only number cannot be in the record, cannot be checked, and will
eventually be read off a screen into a paper.

**And two of those numbers may not be removed, because a welfare ruling rests on them.**
A reward volume of **zero** is allowed — pausing reward without ending a session — and the
PI allowed it on 2026-09-20 **because it is visible** (S8 §5.2c). `fluid session` going
`0.00 mL` is how an operator sees that a correctly-working animal is being paid nothing, and
`supplement` keeps reporting the whole floor as owed so it is topped up afterwards. The
consequence he weighed and accepted is that, while it holds, the animal earns nothing. **So
a console change that stopped showing either — a simplified pane, a folded summary, a
reconciliation that no longer published `fluid_session_ml` — would turn a permitted operation
into a silent one.** That is a welfare regression arrived at by editing a display, which is
the reason this sits in the console spec rather than only in S8.

**Since 2026-09-26 neither is on the always-visible strip** (P4d-2b spec §4.0; asked against
this paragraph, the PI answered "fine as is"): both are on Runtime and End of session in every
state, and `tests/test_web.py::test_fluid_session_and_the_supplement_are_never_dropped` holds
that. What keeps a working, unpaid animal visible at a glance is fluid today standing still on
the strip while the time since the last reward grows.

**And since 2026-09-20 there is a second reason, which changes what `fluid session: 0.00 mL`
means to whoever is reading it.** Asked again, the PI gave the reason behind the ruling:
*"some trials will have a reward period, but they may not receive a juice reward. they may get
an on-screen token reward that eventually becomes a real reward."* So zero is a **designed
trial outcome**, not an edge case being tolerated — **a session sitting at `0.00 mL` may be
running exactly as intended**, and nothing on this screen or downstream of it may treat that
figure as a fault signal. `supplement` is the line that still matters, because a token is not
fluid and the day's floor is owed in millilitres until it converts. Nothing in the task
vocabulary models that token yet (S8 §5.3, §8 item 9).

**Approximation is in the name.** `rt_approx_ms`, never `rt_ms` — online RT is
approximate by decision (PI, 2026-09-19: *"an approximate rt online is fine enough"*),
with the real value recovered offline from sync ticks. Unknown is `None`, never `0`,
following `shortfall()`'s refusal to claim a day went well.

**The console never computes a welfare number.** Fluid shown is what `welfare` says was
*delivered*, never a sum of reward commands issued.

**Telemetry is lossy by design.** ZMQ PUB drops rather than blocks, because latest-wins
telemetry must never stall a frame. The consequence, stated loudly: **the console is a
view, never a source.**

**And a refusal of a welfare-bounded name therefore goes into the session record as well**
(PI, 2026-09-19). A refusal used to reach `Refused` and nothing else, so an attempt to set
a dose above its limit left no durable trace at all unless a console happened to be
attached and happened to still hold the row — which this same section caps. "Somebody
tried to give this animal four times its volume" is asked months later and is answered
from the record or not at all, so `taskd.Session._command` writes a row into
`refusals.jsonl` for any name carrying a `bounds.Ceiling`. An ordinary parameter typo
stays telemetry-only: a slip at a keyboard is not a welfare event, and recording every one
of them would bury the rows that are.

**A pump fault publishes one frame before it propagates** (PI, 2026-09-19). `welfare.Rig`
deliberately does not swallow a pump that will not answer, and that exception used to
leave `taskd.Session.run` with no telemetry at all — a console watching a rig break,
unattended and cage-side, saw the stream simply stop. The loop boundary now sets
`stopped_because` to name the fault, publishes once, and re-raises unchanged. The refusal
is the behaviour that matters; the frame only means a stranger can read what happened off
the screen, which is this spec's own rule for an abort reason.

Schema-versioned with golden-file tests, which ADR-0003 already requires. **`SCHEMA` is
8 as of 2026-09-28** (P4d-2b b2a), and every bump since 2 is the same case: a field
that still decodes and no longer
means what it did, or a new one whose absence a console built against the old number
would misread. `link.SCHEMA`'s comment carries the same history.

- **3 (2026-09-19):** `Staged.bounded` stopped meaning "already live" and became "checked
  against a welfare ceiling", so a console built against 2 would render a lowered reward
  volume as already in effect.
- **4 (2026-09-19):** `chair_seconds` stopped being the number that ends the session;
  `out_of_cage_seconds` is what the ceiling is read against. A console built against 3 would
  show chair time as *the* clock and then watch a session stop on a limit it never displayed.
- **5 (2026-09-20):** `chair_seconds` became `float | None`, and `deployment` and
  `duration_warning` arrived. A console built against 4 renders a `None` chair clock, and one
  that coerced would tell an operator a restrained animal had been restrained for no time at
  all.
- **6 (2026-09-26, P4d-2a):** `phase`, `stop_kind` and `in_session_seconds` arrived. A console
  built against 5 renders an `awaiting_return` frame's advancing out-of-cage clock as a
  running session, can tell a pump fault from a clean finish only by parsing
  `stopped_because`, and has no field for the in-session clock.
- **7 (2026-09-26, P4d-2b b1):** `task`, `allocation`, `bounds_config` and `params` (the
  configuration), `floor_ml` and `out_of_cage_limit_s` (the limits its numbers are read
  against), `wall_at` (the frame's own instant, ledger Ruling 1, 2026-09-27), `last_reward_at`
  and `recent_outcomes` arrived. Nothing changed meaning; a schema-7 reader cannot decode a
  schema-6 frame, which lacks them, so `wlx serve` refuses it and says so on its page rather
  than guessing.
- **8 (2026-09-28, P4d-2b b2a):** `paused_at`, `scheduled_stop` (`ScheduledStop`: kind,
  target, who, and its words), `controls` (`Control`: kind, who, when, and its words) and
  `controls_dropped` arrived — the controls from the box. Nothing changed meaning; each
  reader refuses the other's schema by name.

Trial-rate telemetry on one topic; the replica's display-rate stream, if V11 permits one, on
a separate droppable topic.

**A frame is bounded, and the one list that was not is the refusal feed.** Added
2026-09-19, schema 2. Every other field in `Telemetry` is fixed-width or bounded by the
task (`outcomes` by the outcome enum, `owed` by the block's conditions, `staged` by what
an operator queued in one ITI). `refusals` was cumulative and uncapped, and the party
driving its growth is not the operator: `ZmqLink.drain` records one refusal per wire
packet it cannot decode, so a console built against a bumped `SCHEMA` — the case this
very section's versioning makes likely — adds one per packet, forever, with `Telemetry.of`
re-encoding the whole accumulation at every boundary. It is capped at
`link.REFUSAL_HISTORY` (50), newest kept, with `refusals_dropped` carrying the count of
what fell off so that a cap can never be read as a quiet session. `wlx console` prints
that count above the rows.

**`taskd.Session.refusals` is capped the same way** (2026-09-19). It is the third list fed
by the same peer — one entry per `SetParameter` the session refuses, as fast as a peer can
send them — and was left unbounded when the other two were capped. Two bounded lists
beside one unbounded one is not a policy. Its discards join `ZmqLink.refused_dropped` in
`Telemetry.refusals_dropped`, so the printed count is of everything missing rather than of
one source's share.

## 10. Preflight semantics

S9 §10's open item 2 — what preflight does when a check is *unknown* rather than failed.

**Presence is a load-time refusal; preflight is about condition.** A task needing gaze
will not load on a deployment without gaze (S13 §2 made "absent" a first-class device
state precisely so it is refused at load time with a reason), and `check` already refuses
a chromatic task with no photometer calibration. So preflight never asks *is there a
tracker*, only *is it healthy* — which is a real three-state question.

**One rule, no exceptions** (PI, 2026-09-19):

- **fail** → blocks. A check that has actively failed stops the session.
- **unknown** → proceeds on an **explicit acknowledgement that is written into the session
  record**: which checks were unknown, and who accepted them.
- **pass** → proceeds.

Built in P4d-2b b3a (`wl_xcon/preflight.py`'s `gate`), for runs started from `wlx taskd`;
`wlx run` takes no acknowledgement and records that none was taken.

The failure mode this is shaped against is not proceeding on an unknown. It is **a gate
that cries wolf and gets clicked through**, because a gate people route around protects
nothing. Refusing only on evidence of a problem, and recording acceptance where evidence
is merely absent, keeps a refusal meaningful.

Months later, when data looks odd, the record says *"this session started with the optics
residual unknown, acknowledged by jake"* rather than nothing at all. Same instinct as
`shortfall()` answering `None` and the `unattributed` actor: do not prevent, make it
impossible not to notice, and put it in the data rather than in somebody's memory.

**A dated dependency, stated so the next reader can grep it rather than believe it.**
An absent pump calibration (V10) is acknowledgeable like everything else, and that is
safe *only* because the real pump driver does not exist and may not be written until V10
is measured (`docs/CHECKPOINT.md`, "Open measurements"). An unmeasured millilitre
conversion therefore cannot reach an animal whatever preflight allows. **If anyone writes
that driver, this rule must be revisited before it ships** — at that point an
acknowledgeable unknown would mean a per-delivery ceiling enforced against a number
nobody measured, while appearing to work. Since P4d-2b b3a the code holds this for the runs
`wlx taskd` starts: `preflight.unmeasured` makes the calibration unknown only while the pump
is the simulator or absent, and fails it for any other pump. `wlx run` takes no pre-flight,
so its runs are not covered; today it builds only the simulator's pump.
