# P4d-2b — The browser console and `/health`

- **Status:** §1–§3 approved in conversation on 2026-09-26 (PI). §4 covers slice b1, the
  read-only console, and was approved the same day. §5 covers slice b2, split into b2a
  (controls from the box) and b2b (remote sign-in through wl-works); b2a's design was
  approved in conversation on 2026-09-27, section by section, and b2b's decisions so far
  are recorded in §5.7. **Amended 2026-09-28**, when the PI approved b2a's plan with one
  change — a manual reward during a pause (§5.0) — in §4.0, §5.0–§5.7. Slices b3–b6 get
  their own sections as each is designed. **§6, slice b3a** (sessions from the page), was
  designed and approved in conversation on 2026-09-29, section by section. **Amended
  2026-09-29:** the console's manual reward works whenever the console is up (§6.0).
- **Date:** 2026-09-26
- **Parent:** S9a §6–§9; ADR-0008; `architecture.md`'s `console` and `labhost` rows
- **Depends on:** P4d-2a (`2026-09-26-P4d2a-return-to-cage-design.md`, as amended in its
  §10): `phase`, `stop_kind` and `in_session_seconds` in telemetry schema 6. The page sends
  no return to the cage: the wl-works ELN owns it (PI, 2026-09-26)

---

## 1. Transport and rendering (decided)

- **Stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`**, the stack `wl-preproc`'s responder already runs. No
  new dependency.
- **Server-sent events** carry telemetry to browsers; writes are JSON `POST`s.
- **Panes are rendered to HTML in Python** and pushed as fragments; the page's JavaScript
  only swaps them in. The point is testability: "`fluid session` and `supplement` are never
  dropped" (S9a §9) becomes a pytest assertion on the renderer, as `cli.render` is tested.
- **WebSockets are deferred to the replica pane**, if V11 shows a browser can carry it at
  display rate — the one place binary frames would matter. That is an added endpoint for one
  pane, not a rewrite. **Known limit, accepted:** over HTTP/1.1 a browser holds about six
  connections per host, and each event stream holds one, so a seventh console tab on the
  same box in one browser would stall (MDN's server-sent events guide; not re-verified
  2026-09-26). S9a §7 is amended from "HTTP/WS" when this slice lands.

## 2. Process and security (decided; the write rules apply from slice b2)

- `wlx serve --link PUB,REP --http HOST:PORT --health-token-file PATH`, its own process.
  One `ZmqConsole`. A telemetry thread keeps the latest frame; a command thread owns the
  REQ socket and takes commands from a queue, so each ZMQ socket has one owning thread.
  Each browser gets a bounded queue that drops its oldest frames when it falls behind.
  Restarting `wlx serve` changes nothing in `taskd`.
- **Reads are open to the LAN; writes from the box in b2a, and from people signed in to
  wl-works in b2b** (PI, 2026-09-26; amended 2026-09-27, when the PI asked that "folks that
  are logged into wl-works" be able to write too — which replaces this bullet's earlier
  "until P4d-3"; see §5.7). A write from the box — `POST /commands` without a wl-works
  token — is accepted only when all hold: loopback peer; `Host` names loopback (against
  DNS rebinding); `Origin` is the box's own page (against a cross-site post from a page
  open in the rig PC's browser); `Content-Type: application/json` (forces a preflight this
  server never approves). Until b2b, a refused write says *controls work only at the rig
  PC until remote sign-in arrives*, and the page greys its controls with the same
  sentence.
- **Every request is answered only when its `Host` names this console** (2026-09-27, §5.3):
  loopback, the box's own host name and addresses, and names given with `--allow-host`.
  Anything else is refused, which closes DNS rebinding on the LAN-open reads too; b2b needs
  each rig reached by a known, registered name anyway.
- **Attribution from the box:** the box's page asks for a name once and the console records
  `NAME (box, unverified)` — S9a §6: a forgeable name is worse than none, because it is
  believed. b2b adds the verified actor for signed-in people (§5.7).
- **`/health`**: `Authorization: Bearer` from a token file, never the repository;
  `hmac.compare_digest`; one identical `401` for missing or wrong credentials; `404` for
  unknown paths, `405` for wrong methods, and no stdlib default error page — the rules of
  `wl-preproc`'s `responder/handler.py`, read 2026-09-26.

## 3. Telemetry and `/health` (decided)

**Telemetry, schema 6 → 7** (P4d-2a takes 6). Each field from the object the record is
written from:

- `params` — name, unit, low, high, current value, and whether a welfare ceiling checks it;
  the parameter row is generated from it
- `task`, `allocation`, `bounds_config` — S9a §3's configuration information. Display mode
  and stimulus calibration have no source yet and render as such
- `floor_ml`, `out_of_cage_limit_s` — the day's floor, and the ceiling the clock runs
  against (`None` cage-side)

Drops, tracker staleness and RHX margin have no source and render *not measured*, never 0.

**Behavioral counts, no rollup** (PI, 2026-09-26). Total trials, then every outcome that
occurred with its count, grouped by `Outcome`'s existing documented families — target,
distractor, withhold, no engagement, breaks, rig — encoded on the enum as data rather than
left in comments. No correct/error/aborted definition is invented; one can be added when the
PI defines it (open: fixed on the enum or per task, and where `early_response`,
`late_response` and `no_response` fall). Shown identically on the Working? pane and on
`/health`.

**One rollup is ruled, for the strip only** (PI, 2026-09-26): its *correct* counts `correct`
plus `correct_reject`, since both are the right answer on their trial. Every other count
stays unrolled.

**`/health`** is `wl_preproc.contracts.protocol.HealthResponse`, schema version 1: readings
are plain text, with `<`, `>` and `&` spelled out as `wl-preproc`'s `plain_text` does.
Readings: session (id · subject · task; while nothing readable has arrived but frames
are being refused, "a session is sending on ENDPOINT, but in a format this console cannot
read", the PI's wording, 2026-09-27); state; the reason a frame was refused, when one
was (Ruling 11; approved by the PI, 2026-09-27); time out of cage against its limit,
or *cage-side, no limit*; the duration warning when active; fluid this session; supplement
owed; the behavioral counts above; age of the last frame. **Exactly one is featured**,
because wl-works' home page shows only the first and wl-preproc's responder features
exactly one. It is the most urgent (PI, 2026-09-26, amending the five first marked here):
- the duration warning when active;
- else the state, when the session faulted or ended on the limit and the animal is not back;
- else the refused frame's reason, when a frame was refused since the last one this console
  could read (Ruling 11; approved by the PI, 2026-09-27);
- else the last frame's age, when the stream went stale;
- else the time out of cage. `actions` is
always empty — no welfare action goes through `wl-works`.

| Situation | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Running normally, or no session attached yet | `ok` |
| Duration warning active | `degraded` |
| No frame for `--stale-after` (default 30 s, a display choice) while the last said running | `degraded` |
| A frame arrived that this console cannot read (another schema, or no frame at all), until the next one it can — at once, not after `--stale-after`; a held fault stays `down` (Ruling 11; approved by the PI, 2026-09-27) | `degraded` |
| Ended by the out-of-cage limit, **until the return is recorded** (PI, 2026-09-26) | `degraded` |
| Ended otherwise (completed, operator stop), or ended on the limit and since returned | `ok`, with the reason as a reading |
| Ended by a fault | `down` |

`unknown` is never emitted: it is `wl-works`' word for a silent host. Contract-tested
against `HealthResponse` itself, imported at test time with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`.

## 4. Slice b1: the read-only console (approved 2026-09-26)

The mockup (`docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-09-26-console-mockup-v12.html`) is the page's
design, and the rulings held below say what each part of it is for. Each slice builds the
parts whose data exists. b1 builds the page a person reads: nothing on it writes.

### 4.0 Rulings held from the mockup rounds

Every ruling the PI made while the mockup was iterated (2026-09-26). Each binds the slice that
builds its part; S9a is amended to match when that slice lands.

- **The always-visible strip carries four cells**: fluid today / floor, out-of-cage time /
  8:00 (12:00 when this was ruled; the PI corrected the limit to eight hours on 2026-10-01),
  correct / trials for the session, and time since the last reward. Fluid session
  moves to the runtime tab and the end-of-session summary; the supplement moves to the
  end-of-session summary. Asked against the 09-20 ruling that allowed zero-reward sessions
  *because* fluid session and supplement were always visible (S9a §9): "fine as is". What
  keeps an unpaid working animal visible is fluid today standing still while the time since
  the last reward grows. S9a §9 is amended to say so when this section is written.
  *(Amended 2026-10-01 by the session-levels spec §6: two cells, the fluid box with the
  supplement, the last reward and back to cage, and Correct / trials at the session,
  task, run and block; the supplement returns to the strip.)*
- **The return to the cage is the ELN's, not this page's.** Asked whether the wl-works ELN
  (not yet built) records the return as well as the departure: "Yes, the ELN handles return
  to cage. you can take it out of this interface." The page reads out-of-cage, on the wall
  clock alone, and offers no →cage control; a session ends with an explicit "end session".
- **An in-session clock, kept separately**: from opening the session to ending it,
  expcontroller's own, never mixed with out-of-cage. Asked whether it bounds anything:
  "only shown and recorded."
- **Ending a session packages the code it used**: "an end session function that packages
  all of the interface (wl-expcontroller) and task code that was used in the session ...
  saved and packaged for a seperate backup that can be uploaded to github (maybe?) for
  tracking what was used session to session." Mocked as a package in the session directory
  (so it travels to wl-nas) plus one commit per session to a separate code-record repo.
  Open: which host pushes it to GitHub.
- **Nothing runs until the task library is pulled**: "a button next to the task, that must be
  pressed before anything can run in a new session that pulls the task library from github."
  The pulled commit is recorded with every run. The library is wl-exptasks (wl-mllib until 2026-09-26),
  which is not built out yet. When GitHub cannot be reached, the last version pulled
  runs after a warning and a person's confirmation. The code package goes to wl-nas with
  the session, and pushing it to GitHub is proposed as wl-preproc's job (all PI, 2026-09-26).
- **Load parameters from an earlier session**: "a feature that can pull task parameters for
  an animal from a log that is perhaps stored in the eln ... preload parameters from a
  previous session." The box cannot ask wl-works for the log, so its source is open: pushed
  when a session opens, or read from earlier session records on the box and wl-nas.
- **The GUI review's top ten are accepted** ("I like all of the suggestions at the top"),
  from `docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-09-26-console-review.md` §1 (mockup: `docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-09-26-console-mockup-v12.html`):
  1. a mark control (M);
  2. a trial-phase timeline;
  3. the strip and actions kept in full screen;
  4. a pre-flight checklist that gates start;
  5. start values and the shaping step remembered from the last session;
  6. outcome ticks on Runtime, and trials/min;
  7. recording status;
  8. a scheduled stop and a 60-minute notice;
  9. stalled-animal and tracker alerts;
  10. eye-map quality and recenter drift.
  
  The review's welfare questions were set aside: "the welfare ones are irrelevant, we can
  ignore."
- **Runs follow the plan, and an unplanned run is explicit.** Asked how S8 §1 (blocks are
  planned in wl.works before the session, and wl-preproc quarantines unplanned blocks,
  lowering the timing tier) meets the mockup's free task choice, the PI chose plan first,
  unplanned allowed. The page runs the day's plan in order, pushed from wl.works. A run
  outside the plan is an explicit "unplanned run", with a warning that it lowers the
  session's timing tier.
  *Retired 2026-10-01:* the PI retired this ruling ("Nothing; retire the ruling"), as recorded
  by wl-works, `6a57b1cc` (its spec `2026-10-01-montage-plan-design.md` §1 and §6). wl.works
  sends the rig no day's plan; block plans and conditions come from the task programs
  (wl-xtasks) or are chosen at the rig (backlog XC-207); and wl-preproc withdrew the
  quarantine the timing-tier cost rested on. Every run is just a run, and the page shows no
  unplanned-run warning.
- **P4d-2b is built in six slices, in this order** (PI, 2026-09-26):
  - **b1 — read-only:** the server, the stream, and the read-only page from today's
    telemetry, plus `/health`.
  - **b2 — writes from the box:** parameters, stop, pause, mark, scheduled stop.
  - **b3 — sessions from the page:** new / load / end session, the task-library pull and
    pre-flight. This needs a service on the box that holds a session across runs.
  - **b4 — simulation** with mouse gaze.
  - **b5 — training tools and manual reward** (welfare-critical). *Amended 2026-09-28:*
    a manual reward **during a pause** moved to b2a, at the PI's request when he approved
    b2a's plan (§5.0, §5.1); a manual reward at any other time stays here. *Amended
    2026-09-29:* the manual reward at any other time is ruled in §6.0 and built in its own
    slices; b5 keeps the training tools.
  - **b6 — end of session:** the code package and the wl-nas transfer.
  
  Overlays, behavior plots, online analysis, the parameter log and RHX status come later,
  behind the parts they depend on.

### 4.1 Telemetry, schema 6 → 7

Schema 7 carries §3's fields, plus four more for the strip and the ticks:

- `last_reward_at`: the wall instant of the last reward delivered, taken where `welfare`
  records a delivery; `None` before the first.
- `recent_outcomes`: the last 60 outcomes' wire strings, oldest first, capped like
  `refusals`.
- `in_session_seconds`: P4d-2a's.
- `wall_at`: the frame's own instant on the session's anchored clock, the one wall reading
  `Telemetry.of` already takes, so that `wlx serve` gives the time since the last reward as
  `wall_at − last_reward_at` plus its own steady-clock time since the frame arrived and never
  subtracts its host clock from a session instant, which a host-clock step would throw off
  (ledger Ruling 1, 2026-09-27).

Trials per minute is derived by `wlx serve` from `trial_index` over the wall time of the
frames it has seen in the last five minutes, and the page labels it as derived. It is not a
welfare number and bounds nothing.
*(Amended 2026-10-01 by the session-levels spec §6: the strip shows the rate bare, as
"12.0/min" on the session line, and shows nothing in its place before a rate is derived.)*

### 4.2 What the page shows

- **Header:**
  - the wl.works logo, and a state pill (from `phase` and `stop_kind`);
  - session · subject · deployment · block · trial · in session;
  - presence: this box, or N LAN viewers;
  - a magenta ✕ that closes this page's stream.
- **Strip:** four cells:
  - fluid today / floor;
  - out-of-cage time / limit;
  - correct / trials, with % and trials per minute;
  - time since the last reward.
  
  Fluid session and the supplement are shown on Runtime and End of session instead, as ruled
  in the rulings held above.
  *(Amended 2026-10-01 by the session-levels spec §6: two cells, the fluid box with the
  supplement, the last reward and back to cage, and Correct / trials at the session,
  task, run and block; the supplement returns to the strip.)*
- **Runtime:**
  - trials: the last 60 outcomes as ticks colored by family, with a legend;
  - this run: counts by family, with no rollup;
  - still needed (`owed`);
  - *Wrong?*: hangs, with drops, tracker staleness and RHX margin shown as *not measured*;
  - *wl-works sees*: the `/health` readings, as they would be sent;
  - changes: staged and refused, with `refusals_dropped` when it is not zero.
- **Task parameters, read-only:** one card per entry in `params`: value, unit, range, the
  ceiling flag, and a staged marker.
- **Setup, read-only:** session, subject, deployment, bounds config, allocation.
- **End of session, read-only:** supplement owed (`shortfall_ml`), fluid session,
  out-of-cage time, in-session time, and the stop reason.
- **Fonts are served by the box** (PI, 2026-09-26): IBM Plex Sans, Plex Sans Condensed,
  Plex Mono and Newsreader are bundled and served from `wlx serve`, so the page keeps the
  wl-works look and never reaches the internet. Each font's license is verified against its
  primary source and entered in ADR-0004's inventory when it is added.
- **Right column:** honest placeholders, so the layout never shifts and nothing pretends to be
  live (PI, 2026-09-26): *replica · V11*, *subject display · no source yet*,
  *sound · not measured*, *display · not measured*.
- **Absent until their slices:** every write control, and overlays, behavior, training tools,
  online analysis, full screen, pre-flight and simulation.

### 4.3 When the stream falters

- **On connect:** one full render, then the fragments that changed, once per frame and once
  per keepalive interval between frames, each re-rendered from a fresh snapshot, so what
  ages between frames — the time since the last reward, *wl-works sees* — moves on the page.
  Every event carries `age`, the seconds `wlx serve` has held the latest frame on its steady
  clock (`null` before any) (Ruling 12, 2026-09-27).
- **Stale** (no frame for `--stale-after`): a banner reading *stream stale · last frame N s
  ago*, and the values are greyed. The page's timer runs only while frames are due, from a
  baseline of the event's arrival less its `age`, both on `performance.now()` (monotonic,
  so a browser clock step cannot skew it): stale once *now − baseline* reaches
  `--stale-after` (`>=`, matching `/health`'s own boundary), and N is *now − baseline*. So
  a page that connects onto an already-old frame, or is woken by a refused one, does not
  restart the clock, and a `null` age runs no timer (Ruling 12, 2026-09-27).
- **Lost:** a banner reading *stream lost*, and the values are greyed as when stale
  (2026-09-27: the stale timer stands down while the stream is lost, so without this the
  banner sat over full-color numbers). The browser reconnects on its own and re-renders in
  full when it does.
- **The ✕** closes the page's stream and says *disconnected · the session keeps running on the
  box*, with a reconnect button.

### 4.4 Testing (sim first)

- **The renderer is pure** (telemetry in, HTML fragments out) and is tested like `cli.render`:
  - fluid session, supplement, out-of-cage time, the duration warning, and
    `refusals_dropped` when it is above zero are never dropped;
  - *not measured* is never rendered as 0;
  - every telemetry string is HTML-escaped. A refusal carrying `<script>` is the test.
- **The handler:** `GET /`, `GET /events` and `GET /health` (bearer) are served. Everything
  else gets 404 or 405, with no stdlib error page. b1 has no `POST`.
- **End to end:** `wlx run --link` in the simulator and `wlx serve`, on loopback. An HTTP
  client reads the event stream and sees the trial count advance, then the ended state.
- **`/health`** is contract-tested against `HealthResponse` with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`.
- **The mutation gate's module lists** gain the server and the web renderer.
- **The page's JavaScript** only opens the stream, swaps fragments by id, and runs the stale
  timer, so everything worth testing is in Python.

## 5. Slice b2: controls (b2a approved 2026-09-27; amended 2026-09-28)

b2 is split in two (PI, 2026-09-27): **b2a**, the controls, sent from the box; then **b2b**,
the same controls for people signed in to wl-works. b2a ships and is used while wl-works
registers the rigs and the rigs gain their route to it (§5.7), which b2b cannot do without.

### 5.0 Rulings (PI, 2026-09-27, asked in plain terms)

- **Pause shows a plain background:** the task's background color, nothing drawn on it.
- **A mark goes to the session record and into the neural recording's event stream**, and
  **it is stamped in the frame it reaches the rig, not at the next trial boundary.** Asked
  whether boundary stamping was acceptable, the PI answered that marks must be instant.
- **A setting is sent when the arrows stop being clicked** (the mockup's debounce), and shows
  *staged* until the next trial.
- **No earlier limit warning:** the 30-minute warning stays the only one. The GUI review's
  item 8 proposed an earlier stage; it is dropped.
- **People signed in to wl-works may write** (§2), and **they get every b2 control, reward
  size included**, still capped by its approved ceiling. The rig PC keeps every control.
  This supersedes the line in wl-expcontroller's 2026-08-31 handover to wl-works
  (`wl-works/HANDOVER-wl-expcontroller.md`) that reward, stimulation and parameter changes
  need a person at the console — for signed-in, attributed writes. wl-works is told so
  with b2b.
- **Rig machines may connect to wl-works** ("i think its fine if the rig machines can
  connect to wl-works"). A permission, not a route: see §5.7.
- **A manual reward during a pause** (PI, 2026-09-28, approving b2a's plan: "I want to be
  able to give manual rewards during pause"). Asked how much one press gives, he chose
  **"Same as a correct trial"**: one press delivers the task's current reward size, and
  nothing new is set. The engineering calls that follow from it (§5.1–§5.3) were stated to
  him the same day. Any-time manual reward stays in b5 (§4.0). *Amended 2026-09-29:* it
  is ruled in §6.0.

### 5.1 What the rig does

Commands are still read by `taskd` only at a trial boundary (`taskd.py`, the loop's
`link.drain()`), except the mark's own signal (below).

- **Commands on the wire.** Today's closed union, `SetParameter | Stop`, gains `Pause`,
  `Resume`, `Mark`, `ScheduleStop` and `CancelScheduledStop` — and, since 2026-09-28,
  `ManualReward` — each carrying `by`. Every one is written to the session record with who
  sent it and when.
- **M8 closes first.** `SetParameter.value` is a type hint that nothing enforces: a string
  reaching `bounds._finite` raises `TypeError`, which `Session._command` does not catch, so
  `run()`'s fault handler ends the whole session. The value is checked where the command is
  decoded (a finite real number, not a `bool`, or a string for a categorical parameter)
  and a bad one becomes a refusal with a sentence. `Session._command` also refuses on a
  type error, as a backstop. The session never ends because a setting was malformed.
- **Pause.** At the next trial boundary the loop holds: no trial runs, the display shows the
  task's background color, and **the task rewards nothing; a person may give one
  correct-trial reward per press** (amended 2026-09-28, the PI's answer in §5.0; below).
  While paused the rig still, once per housekeeping interval, drains commands (resume,
  stop, marks, schedules, settings, manual rewards), publishes telemetry, and **checks the
  out-of-cage limit with `welfare.must_stop`, ending the session on it exactly as between
  trials**. The out-of-cage clock keeps running.
  Settings staged while paused apply when trials resume. Stop while paused ends the
  session. Pause and resume are recorded, and are strobed as framework events (`pause`,
  `resume`) so the recording shows the gap.
- **Manual reward, while paused** (2026-09-28, the PI's answer in §5.0):
  - **only while the session is held paused at the trial boundary.** A reward command at
    any other time — while trials run, after a pause is requested but before the boundary
    holds it, after the session has ended — is refused with a plain sentence, nothing is
    given, and the session goes on;
  - **one press is one delivery of the bounded config's `reward_correct`**, at the value it
    holds then, **through the path a task's reward takes** (`welfare.Rig.reward` →
    `Welfare.deliver`): charged before the valve opens, and counted in the session's
    commanded fluid, its deliveries and the time of its last reward. A config with no
    `reward_correct` refuses the press, naming the entry; **no other entry ever stands
    in**. `welfare.py` and `bounds.py` are called, not changed;
  - **recorded like every control:** a row in the session record with who, when, the
    trial and the mL given, and a framework event (`manual_reward`) strobed before the
    delivery, as `REWARD_COMMANDED` precedes a task's reward, so a recording tells it from
    a task's reward and from a panel press (S6 §4);
  - **it counts toward "stop after X mL"**: a manual reward that reaches the target ends
    the session as a scheduled stop does, in the same housekeeping pass that checks the
    out-of-cage limit, without waiting for a resume;
  - **no accidental doubles:** each accepted command is exactly one reward, never
    deduplicated and **never re-sent** (§5.3).
- **Mark, stamped instantly.** Draining every command per frame would break the trial loop's
  rules, so a mark has two parts:
  - a **signal**: a fixed-size sequence number the loop checks once per frame with no
    allocation and bounded work, and on seeing it strobes `operator_mark` in that frame.
    Proposed mechanism, settled by the plan and the measurement: a third loopback socket on
    the link, read per frame through its `EVENTS` option and `recv_into` a preallocated
    buffer. The check runs between trials and while paused too;
  - the **note**, with who sent it, as an ordinary `Mark` command, drained at the next
    boundary and joined to its stamp by the sequence number.

  The record keeps three instants: when M was pressed (the browser's clock, labeled as
  such), when `wlx serve` received it, and when the rig stamped it (its session clock and
  frame). The gap between them is recorded, never hidden.
- **Scheduled stop**, held by `taskd`, so a closed page cannot lose it. Three kinds:
  - at a clock time on the rig's session clock — the next occurrence of that time,
    within 24 hours;
  - after N more trials, counted from when the schedule is accepted, and shown as the
    target trial number;
  - after X mL this session, read from `welfare`'s session fluid.

  Checked at each trial boundary (and while paused), it stops the session like the stop
  button: `stop_kind` `operator`, the reason *scheduled stop (…) set by NAME*. One at a
  time: a new schedule replaces the old, and `CancelScheduledStop` removes it.
- **Settings** keep today's behavior: validated when offered, staged, applied at the next
  trial boundary, every change recorded.
- **Telemetry schema 8** adds what the page needs: whether the session is paused and since
  when, the scheduled stop (kind, target, who), and a bounded list of recent control events
  (pause, resume, mark with its note, schedule, cancel, and since 2026-09-28 a manual
  reward) for the changes feed. A schema-7 reader refuses schema 8, as §3's schema rule
  already says.
- **Event codes.** `operator_mark`, `pause` and `resume` — and, since 2026-09-28,
  `manual_reward` — are new framework event names in the allocation
  (`codes.Allocation.code_for`), in the task-specific range while ADR-0007's `TaskEvent`
  range is being moved; wl-exptasks owns the final numbering.

### 5.2 The page

- **Settings:** each parameter card gets up/down arrows and an input. A change is sent about
  600 ms after the last click (a debounce, housekeeping and not a measurement). The card
  shows *staged* until the next trial, then the new value. A refusal shows on the card and
  in the feed, with its sentence.
- **Stop:** a button with a confirm step (*stop at a trial boundary, after any commands
  already sent?*). It read *stop at the next trial boundary?* until the b2a final fix
  wave, 2026-09-28. That was exact only with nothing queued, because `wlx serve` delivers
  queued commands one trial boundary apart (S9a). Letting a stop go ahead of them is b2b's.
- **Pause / resume:** one button, and the **P** key.
- **Mark:** the **M** key, or a button, sends the signal at once. A note box then opens:
  Enter attaches the note to that mark and Esc leaves it bare.
- **Give reward** (2026-09-28, §5.0): a button in the control bar, **live only while the
  session is paused** and greyed with its reason otherwise; no key. It is held from the
  click until that command's answer or its failure arrives, and shows what the rig did —
  the mL given, or the refusal's sentence — beside the session's fluid total, which moves
  on the next frame. Pause stays *pause or resume*, never a toggle. `wlx console` stays
  render-only.
- **Scheduled stop:** a small form (clock time, N trials, or mL this session). While a
  schedule is active the strip shows it, for example *stop at 14:30 · set by jake*, with a
  cancel button.
- **Keys** do nothing while a text box has focus.
- **The changes feed** lists every setting change, refusal, pause, resume, mark (with its
  note), schedule and — since 2026-09-28 — manual reward, with who did it, rendered in
  Python like every other pane.
- **Name:** the box's browser asks once and remembers it locally; commands carry it and are
  recorded as `NAME (box, unverified)`.
- **Everywhere but the box**, the controls are greyed with the §2 sentence.
- **The script's scope grows** past §4.3's list: it also sends commands, debounces the arrows,
  handles P and M, and asks for the name. It still renders nothing itself.

### 5.3 Sending

- **`POST /commands`** takes one JSON command. It is accepted only under §2's four checks,
  and its body is validated before anything is queued. `wlx serve` gets the **command
  thread** §2 always named: it alone owns the REQ socket and takes commands from a bounded
  queue.
- **The page is told the truth about delivery.** *Sent* only when `taskd` has acknowledged
  receipt. *Not delivered* when the REQ exchange times out, after which the socket is reset
  (a REQ socket cannot send twice without a reply). *Busy* when the queue is full. Whether
  the rig accepted or refused a command shows in the feed, from telemetry, as today.
- **The mark's signal** goes on its own path to the rig's mark socket as soon as it
  arrives, ahead of the queue.
- **A manual reward is never re-sent** (2026-09-28). Nothing on the command path re-sends
  any command; a reward the rig took and did not acknowledge may have been given, so the
  page is told *unknown*, with a sentence to check the fluid total before pressing again,
  never *not delivered*. A test pins that one press puts one command on the wire.
- **`Host` is checked on every request** (§2). `--allow-host NAME`, repeatable, adds names;
  the defaults are loopback and the box's own host names and addresses. A refused request
  gets a JSON 421 and no page.

### 5.4 Testing, and the measurement

- **Sim first, end to end:** a real `wlx run --link` in the simulator and a real `wlx serve`,
  on loopback, driven through `POST /commands` the way the page drives it:
  - a setting goes from staged to applied at the next trial;
  - a malformed setting (M8) is refused, shown in the feed, and the session runs on;
  - pause holds `trial_index`, keeps the out-of-cage clock running, and still ends the
    session when the limit arrives mid-pause; resume continues;
  - a mark puts `operator_mark` into the recorded event stream in the frame it arrives,
    and the record holds its three instants and its note;
  - each kind of scheduled stop ends the session with its reason, and cancel removes it;
  - a write from a non-loopback peer, or to an unknown `Host`, is refused;
  - with `taskd` gone, the page is told *not delivered*;
  - (2026-09-28) a reward pressed while trials run is refused on the feed; one pressed
    while paused gives exactly one `reward_correct`, and the fluid total, the record and
    the recorded event stream all show it.
- **The renderer** stays pure and is tested as in §4.4, with the new controls, feed rows and
  strip item.
- **The measurement** (CLAUDE.md: no timing claim without one). A script in `tools/`
  measures the per-frame mark check's cost in the frame loop, with and without it, and
  commits its results under `docs/measurements/`. The effect on real frame timing is added
  to the hardware verification list. **If the check measurably disturbs frames, it goes back
  to the PI before b2a ships.**
- **The mutation gate** sweeps every changed module, read line by line (trap 7).

### 5.5 Human review before b2a merges

Welfare-critical by CLAUDE.md, given to the PI as numbered items in plain terms:

1. While paused, the task rewards nothing, a person at the box may give one correct-trial
   reward per press (the bounded config's `reward_correct`, counted in the fluid total and
   toward "stop after X mL"), and the out-of-cage limit still ends the session. *Amended
   2026-09-28, the PI's answer in §5.0; it was "nothing is rewarded".*
2. A scheduled stop, including "after X mL", can end a session.
3. Reward size can be changed from the console page, still capped by its approved ceiling.
4. The M8 fix: a malformed setting is refused and never ends the session.

### 5.6 Outside this repository

- The four new event names go into the allocation (three, and `manual_reward` since
  2026-09-28); wl-exptasks owns the final numbering.
- With b2b, not before: tell wl-works that its handover's "a person at the console" line
  is superseded for signed-in writes (§5.0), and ask it to register each rig's client.
  **Asked 2026-09-29**, with the three further changes b2b turned out to need there
  (`docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`, "Signing in from a rig's page"; backlog XC-102,
  XC-147 to XC-149). The PI chose to build b3 while wl-works answers.

### 5.7 b2b, remote sign-in: decided so far (PI, 2026-09-27)

> **Designed in full on 2026-10-02, in its own file:**
> `2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin-design.md`, after wl-works deployed rig sign-in that day
> (`4eb2c568`). Where the two differ, that file is the design; this section is kept as the record
> of what was decided before it. It extends §5.0's "every control" to b3a's session controls (the
> PI, 2026-10-02: "Everything"), and names the actor types `Box` and `Member`.

Designed in full as its own section when b2a has shipped. Decided now:

- **Who:** people signed in to wl-works, with every b2 control (§5.0). **The manual reward
  during a pause is one of them** (2026-09-28): it follows the PI's 2026-09-27 ruling for
  remote users in §5.0 — remote gets everything, reward size included — and is not asked
  again.
- **How:** **the browser holds the wl-works access token and presents it with each command**,
  and the rig verifies it. The PI chose this over the rig holding its own sign-in session,
  knowing that **a deactivated account keeps working until its token expires**.
- **What wl-works offers** (its source, read 2026-09-27):
  - a full OAuth2/OIDC provider (better-auth 1.7.1's `mcp()` plugin, with `jwt()`);
  - an access token that is an RS256 JWT, verifiable offline against `GET /api/auth/jwks`,
    **only when the client asks for a `resource`** — otherwise it is opaque;
  - `/oauth2/introspect` for a live check;
  - a ban or deactivation does not invalidate a JWT already issued.
- **Needs outside this repo:**
  - a registered client, with a redirect URI, per rig name (a wl-works ask);
  - **a network route from each rig to wl-works.** Today wl-works sits behind a rented VPS
    front door, and the lab LAN has no route to its WireGuard side. The permission is the
    PI's (§5.0); the route is infrastructure, and his.
- **wl-works' answer, 2026-09-29** (`docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`, "Signing in from a
  rig's page", which records it in full): **yes to all four changes**, built after its row
  45a-2. What it settles for this design:
  - the rig verifies an RS256 JWT whose `aud` is the rig page's own origin, `iss` read from
    wl.works' OpenID configuration, keys from its public JWKS (cached), and `exp`; the member
    is `sub`, their name the `name` claim;
  - the access token lasts one hour and renews for up to 24 hours while the wl.works sign-in
    lasts; a member needs wl.works' `control-rigs` permission, checked at sign-in and renewal;
  - **the rig page must be https**, so `wlx serve` gains TLS and each rig a name and certificate
    (XC-151); **the rig page needs a sign-out**, since on a shared iPad a token otherwise
    outlives "Done" by up to an hour;
  - **the private route above is probably not needed**: the browser signs in at wl.works'
    public address and the rig fetches its public keys, provided the university network lets
    `wl.works` through.
- **Carried from S9a §6:**
  - the actor is `Verified(person, issuer, token id)` for a signed-in person and stays
    `NAME (box, unverified)` at the box;
  - the box path is a permanent peer, never an emergency hatch;
  - a token expiring mid-session interrupts nothing.

## 6. Slice b3a: sessions from the page (approved in conversation 2026-09-29)

b3 is cut in two (PI, 2026-09-29, asked in the UI): **b3a**, a service on the rig that holds
one animal's session across several runs, opened, run and ended from the page, with the
pre-flight list; then **b3b**, the task-library pull from GitHub and the day's plan sent
from wl-works, once wl-xtasks has tasks (it is an empty scaffold today) and wl-works sends
plans. b3a was designed in three sections, each approved as written below. *(2026-10-01:
wl.works sends the rig no day's plan, §4.0, so b3b is the task-library pull alone: backlog
XC-150.)*

### 6.0 Rulings (PI, 2026-09-29, asked in plain terms)

- **Cut b3 into b3a and b3b** ("Session service first").
- **The page takes the departure and the return**, as the wl-works ELN's stand-in, under the
  terminal's exact rules. Asked where the two times should be entered once sessions run from
  the page: "The page takes both times." **This amends P4d-2a spec §10**, where the return was
  terminal-only and "the browser will not send it" (PI, 2026-09-26: "you can take it out of
  this interface"). The ELN still owns both ends once it exists; the page, like the terminal,
  is its stand-in until then. The page's route into those times is **welfare-critical** and
  goes to the PI for review before merge (§6.4).
- **One always-on rig service** ("One always-on rig service"), over a launcher with one
  process per session or the page's server starting each run: all of one animal's welfare
  state lives in one process, which is the shape S9a §7 already drew.
- **The console's manual reward works whenever the console is up.** Asked whether a person
  may reward by hand between runs, the PI answered yes, "and during task performance.
  supplemental manual rewards are common. effectively, whenever the console is up, the
  manual reward should work." Two details were then asked in plain terms:
  - **During a trial, the reward reaches the animal the moment it is pressed** ("The
    moment it's pressed"), not at the trial's end. It takes a per-frame path like the
    mark's signal (§5.1), and its delay is measured on the rig before it is trusted.
  - **With no session open, the button flushes the line** ("Yes, for flushing the line"):
    the valve opens, and the record says the fluid went to no animal and counts toward
    nobody's daily total.
  - Wherever a session is open (running, paused, between runs, or awaiting the return),
    one press is one delivery of the session's `reward_correct` at its current value,
    through the path a task's reward takes, charged, recorded and strobed as §5.1's paused
    reward is.
  - **Where each is built:** between runs, with b3a-2; during a trial, and with no session
    open, each in its own slice (the first needs the per-frame path and its measurement,
    the second a size with no task to take it from). All three are welfare-critical and
    go to the PI for review before merge.

### 6.1 The rig service

- **`wlx taskd`** runs all day on the rig PC. It is started with the rig's settings file
  (`--rig`, as `wlx run` takes it), the folder of per-animal files (`--subjects`), the task
  folder (`--tasks`), the allocation (`--allocation`), the session root (`--root`) and the
  console link (`--link PUB,REP[,MARK]`, loopback unless `--link-allow-remote`, as now). All
  required but the allocation and the mark endpoint, as for `wlx run`.
- **Idle** until a session opens: it publishes a frame whose `phase` is `idle`, and the page
  shows *no session open* beside the form that opens one.
- **One session at a time, any number a day**, because one rig holds one animal at a time: a
  rig may run monkey A in the morning and monkey B in the afternoon, one session each (PI,
  2026-09-29, a reminder while this was being planned). A session holds several **runs**, one
  after another. **Welfare state belongs to the session, which is one animal's**: its
  out-of-cage interval, its fluid (with what the animal was already given today, from
  wl-works) and its restraint live in the session and outlast every run, and none of it
  carries from one animal's session to the next. A new session opens once the previous one
  has ended with its animal's return.
- **Stop ends the run, not the session.** Between runs (`phase` `between_runs`) the
  out-of-cage clock keeps running and is published. **The out-of-cage limit** ends a run in
  progress, as it ends a session today; reached between runs, it refuses a new run, and the
  page asks for the return. A scheduled stop (b2a) ends the run it was set on.
- **Nothing is quietly lost to a crash.** Everything a session has done is in its record as it
  happens. On start, the service looks under `--root` for a session with a departure and no
  return; while one exists it **refuses to open a new session**, for that animal or any other,
  until someone records that animal's return time, and the page shows the stranded session and
  asks for it. An animal out of its cage is never forgotten because a process died.
  **Resume beside end** (XC-026, 2026-10-01; the PI: "Resume or end";
  [its spec](2026-10-01-xc026-resume-design.md) §5): the stranded banner offers *resume
  session* beside *end session…*. A resume reopens the same session from its record, between
  runs (or waiting for its return, when End session was pressed before its process stopped:
  the PI, 2026-10-01, "Bring it back waiting"), with its departure read from the record and its
  numbers carried on; it is not a new
  session, so the refusal above still holds for an open, and with two stranded each is resumed
  or ended on its own. A record that cannot carry a resume — written before XC-026, or one it
  cannot read — is offered only *end*, and the banner says why. A resume of an animal already
  past its out-of-cage limit is refused when sent, before anything is written; the page then
  asks for the return, and the banner offers only *end* from then on, saying why (XC-026 spec
  §5). A resume of an animal whose bounds changed since the session opened is refused the same
  way but stays offered, since restoring its file makes the session resumable again.
- **`wlx run` stays**, for the terminal: it opens a session, runs one run and ends it, through
  the same session and run code as the service, so the terminal and the page are two peers on
  one path and not two implementations.
- **`wlx serve` is unchanged in kind**: its own process, restartable without touching
  `taskd`, as S9a §7 requires. It gains the commands below and the page's forms.

### 6.2 Opening, running and ending a session from the page

Writes only from the rig PC's own browser (§2's four checks), until b2b.

- **Open.** The page asks for:
  - the operator's name, once, as now (`NAME (box, unverified)`);
  - **the session id**, as `wlx run --session-id` takes it, until the sync box mints session
    identity (wl-sync owns it); a second session on one rig in one day has its own id, and an
    id already used under `--root` is refused;
  - **the animal**, chosen from the folders under `--subjects`, each named for its subject and
    holding its bounded config (`bounds.py`, defining `BOUNDS`, whose subject must match) and,
    for the stereoscope, its settings (`settings.py`, defining `SETTINGS`); an animal whose
    files are missing, or whose files name another subject, is refused;
  - **the deployment kind**, head-fixed or chaired (`rig-fixed`, `rig-chaired`);
  - **the setup**, direct or stereoscope (direct view part 2's rules);
  - **the departure time**, a clock time as `--out-of-cage-at` takes it;
  - the fluid already given today, optional, from wl-works (`--delivered-today`).
- **The departure follows the terminal's rules exactly.** The page sends the text as typed;
  the service parses it with the terminal's own parser and applies `welfare`'s own refusals:
  not in the future, not longer ago than the subject's ceiling. A departure more than
  `welfare.CONFIRM_MARK_WITHIN` ago is answered *confirm or amend*, and the page offers exactly
  the terminal's two choices: confirm it, or amend it with a reason and a name (PI,
  2026-09-20). **One shared piece of code decides**, called by the terminal and by the service,
  so the rules cannot drift.
- **Each run.**
  - **The task** is chosen from `--tasks`. Every run is **unplanned** until b3b brings the day's
    plan, and the page says so each time, with the warning that an unplanned run lowers the
    session's timing tier (§4.0).
    *Retired 2026-10-01:* the PI retired the unplanned-run ruling, as recorded by wl-works,
    `6a57b1cc` (§4.0). No day's plan comes, the page no longer warns, and `runs.jsonl`'s start
    row no longer carries `unplanned`.
  - **Pre-flight** is shown before the run starts, under S9a §10's one rule: **fail blocks,
    unknown proceeds on a named acknowledgement written into the record, pass proceeds.** The
    items today: the task's load-time checks in the session's setup (fail if any blocks); the
    bounded config and, in the stereoscope, the settings (fail if refused); the out-of-cage
    mark (`welfare.preflight`); the pump calibration (V10) and the eye tracker's health, both
    **unknown** until measured.
  - **Starting values** are the task's own. Remembering an animal's values from its last
    session stays with XC-018.
  - **During a run**, the controls are b2a's, unchanged.
- **End.** *End session* asks for the return time, under the terminal's return rules: not
  before the departure, not in the future, confirmed if far from now; there is no amendment for
  a return, because nothing has been marked yet that one could replace (the terminal's own
  rule). The session then closes and the page shows its summary. A run still in progress is
  stopped first.

### 6.3 The record, the recording's events, and the consoles

- **One session folder per session**, as now.
  - **`runs.jsonl`**, new: one row per run: its index, task, allocation and their versions, the
    parameter layers it started with, when it started and ended (wall), `unplanned` (dropped
    2026-10-01 with the ruling it recorded, §4.0), the pre-flight results with who acknowledged
    each unknown, and why it stopped.
  - **Every trial row names its run.**
  - **`config.json`** holds what is fixed for the whole session: the animal, the deployment, the
    bounded config, the rig, the subject settings and the setup. What varies by run moves to
    `runs.jsonl`.
  - wl-preproc reads only the eye-calibration files from `xcon/` (its source, read 2026-09-29:
    `wl_preproc/eye/xcon.py` and `schema/eye.py`), so nothing it depends on moves.
- **The neural recording's events:** `RUN_START` and `RUN_END`, provisionally **4135** and
  **4136** in our range beside `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `OPERATOR_MARK` and `MANUAL_REWARD`
  (4131–4134); wl-xtasks owns the final numbering. The recording then shows where each task
  began and ended.
- **Telemetry, schema 10:** `phase` gains `idle` and `between_runs`; each frame carries the run
  index (`None` when no run has started); the run about to start carries its pre-flight
  results; the out-of-cage and fluid cells stay live between runs. Unknown stays `None`,
  never `0` (S9a §9). **Schema 11** (b3a-2's final review, §6.7): the idle frame also
  carries the last closed session's summary until the next session opens.

### 6.4 Human review before b3a merges

Welfare-critical, and presented to the PI as a numbered summary to approve:
- the shared departure and return code, and the page's route into it (the service's parsing,
  refusals, confirmation and amendment answers);
- the rule that no new session opens while an animal is stranded, and how a stranded session
  is found and closed;
- anything else the plan adds to `docs/design/architecture.md`'s welfare-critical list.

### 6.5 Testing (sim first)

The service runs over the real ZMQ link with the simulated animal, card and pump. End-to-end
tests, each through the page's endpoints as well as the service's commands:
- open a session, two runs, end it;
- the out-of-cage limit reached between runs refuses a new run and asks for the return;
- a crash and restart refuses a new session until the stranded animal's return is recorded;
- an unknown pre-flight item acknowledged by name, and found in `runs.jsonl`;
- every refusal of the departure and the return, through the page exactly as through the
  terminal.

### 6.6 Decided by the b3a-1 plan (2026-09-29), for the PI's review with §6.4

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-29-p4d2b-b3a1-session-service.md` decided what this section
left open; the welfare ones are in §6.4's summary.
- **End session releases the head, then takes the return** (plan decision 6): the release is
  recorded when End session is pressed, so it is pressed as the animal leaves the chair; the
  return follows in the same command or a later one. A return typed earlier than the release
  is refused by `welfare`'s existing cross-check; `now` is always accepted.
- **`runs.jsonl` has two rows per run**, `start` and `end`, joined by `run` (decision 4), so a
  run's start and its acknowledgements are on disk before its first trial.
- **Stranded** means a `departure` row with no `returned` after it, which includes `wlx run`'s
  `return not recorded` sessions and a record with a torn line (decision 10).
- **`wlx taskd` needs an allocation carrying `HEAD_FIXED`, `HEAD_RELEASED`, `PARAM_CHANGED`,
  `RUN_START` and `RUN_END`** (decision 12), where §6.1 listed `--allocation` as optional.
- **The idle frame is its own shape** on the same socket and schema (decision 8), and
  **pre-flight adds a starting-values item** (decision 13); `RUN_END` is strobed only for a
  run that ended by design (decision 5).

And by the plan's review, while it was built (2026-09-29), each in `wl_xcon/service.py` or
`wl_xcon/preflight.py`:
- **A confirm or an amend is taken only as the answer to a question the service posed**
  (`service._unasked`): for that mark, that session and the instant it asked about, and for
  a departure the animal, deployment and setup of the open it asked about. A far mark is
  therefore always two requests, the first answered by the question on the frame; the
  question stays until it is answered or replaced, so a refused answer can be corrected.
- **A session id, an animal, a task, and a stranded record's animal are each one folder
  name** (`service._folder_name`, decision 19 extended): a stranded record whose animal is
  not one is refused, its `bounds.py` never loaded, until the record is repaired by hand.
- **The pump calibration is an acknowledgeable unknown only while the pump is the simulator
  or absent** (`preflight.unmeasured`); any other pump fails the item, which is S9a §10's
  dated dependency as a refusal rather than a reminder.
- **An End refused before anything is marked stops no run** (`Service._unended`): one naming
  another session, or confirming a return nobody was asked about, is refused during a run
  exactly as between runs.

### 6.7 Decided by the b3a-2 plan (2026-09-30), for the PI's review with §6.4

`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-30-p4d2b-b3a2-page-sessions.md` decided what this section
left open; the welfare ones are in its summary for the PI.
- **Starting values are the task's own, declared on each parameter** (plan decision 1):
  `Param.start`, under what a run is given, both layers in its `runs.jsonl` start row (S8
  §3.4), for `wlx taskd`'s runs and `wlx run`'s alike, which takes a task's own value where
  `--set` gives none. A `start` is a finite number (never a `bool`) inside the parameter's
  own declared range, or nothing: `Param` refuses any other as the task is built (the
  range since the final review, m2, since `wlx run` takes no pre-flight), so a task
  declaring one fails to load and its pre-flight fails it.
  `fixation_detection` declares the values the mockup shows (the other reference tasks
  declare none yet, XC-183). A `wlx taskd` run of a task that uses a number with no value,
  or a parameter it never declares, is refused by its pre-flight, naming each (decision 2).
- **The hand reward between runs and while the return is awaited** (decision 4) is given in
  a `wlx taskd` session, and its record row says where it was given (`where`, the feed's
  words, while paused too); during a trial (XC-157), with no session open (XC-158) and after
  a `wlx run` session's run (XC-184) it stays refused. §5.2's *give reward* is live between
  runs and while the return is awaited, as well as while paused.
- **The page's four commands are built by the wire's own function** (decision 3,
  `link._command_from`), and answered *sent* with what the page will show.
- **A far return's warning offers what the rig takes** (decision 16, the controller's ruling
  of 2026-09-30): "Confirm it, or type it again", since a return has no amendment; a far
  departure's warning is unchanged. Words only, in `welfare.py`, whose
  `return_needs_confirmation` docstring no longer names an amendment path. A command sent
  while the return is awaited is refused naming the page's *record return…*.
- **The page's forms** (decisions 6-12): the mockup's `dlg-new`, `pf-panel`, `pf-pill`,
  `a-start`, `a-stop` and `end-confirm`, with the departure typed and no `now` for it, the
  id typed, deployment, setup and fluid given today added, no rig or save folder, an
  acknowledgement box per unknown item, the run's trial count (1000, `wlx run`'s default),
  *end session* then *record return…*, and a stranded animal's *end session…* on its banner.

And by the branch's final review, which drove the page in a browser (2026-09-30):
- **The closed session's summary is shown until the next session opens** (I2): `wlx
  taskd`'s idle frame carries the closed session's last frame (`Idle.closed`, telemetry
  **schema 11**), and the End tab renders it, supplement owed first, as it renders any
  closed frame; unknown stays `None`.
- ***New session* starts empty** (I1): the subject starts on "choose the animal", and the
  departure, id and fluid given today are cleared once the page shows the session it sent
  open; a refused or unanswered open keeps them for a retry.
- **A refused open, check, start or end shows in the control bar** (I3), the newest with
  its sentence, wherever the person is; while *New session* is open, the script's own
  messages show in it.
- **Choosing a task takes the pre-flight only between runs** (m1).
- **A starting value outside its declared range is refused as the task loads** (m2),
  above.

## 7. Not in this slice

- Plots (accuracy over time, RT distribution, accuracy by position) — their own slice, with
  the per-trial RT and bounded history they need (PI, 2026-09-26)
- The replica pane — gated on V11
- **Cameras** — their own package, **P9**, designed 2026-09-27
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-P9-camera-system-design.md`). It supersedes the single
  "animal camera" first sketched here the same day. P9 is one headless camera box per rig,
  part of expcontroller, running 2–4 dual-purpose Blackfly S cameras (8 at most) that
  record behavior and serve as the always-on view of the animal. They are
  primary-triggered at 200 fps, and a camera failure pauses trials through b2a's pause. P9
  is built after b2a.
