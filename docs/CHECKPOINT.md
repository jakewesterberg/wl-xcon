# Where this build actually is

**Last updated 2026-10-07**, at the commit this file was committed in. Check
`git log --oneline -1`; if it has moved far, distrust the numbers here before you
distrust the reasoning. Numbers go stale, arguments do not.

> **Naming.** The repository is `wl-xcon` since 2026-09-28 and the Python package `wl_xcon`
> since 2026-09-29 (XC-053). **Entries dated before 2026-09-29 keep the names they were
> written with**, `wl-expcontroller` and `wl_expcontroller/…` paths included, as the PI
> ruled for dated documents; read `wl_expcontroller/taskd.py` there as `wl_xcon/taskd.py`.
>
> **This file describes `main`.** Its newest entry, "What moved on 2026-10-07: demo mode
> designed and parked, and the order changed", sets the next four builds, the default color
> calibration first. Below it, "What moved on 2026-10-06: b2b-ready, the
> https page safe to switch on", makes nothing about the https page able to stop `wlx serve`, and
> ends every stuck sign-in at its lapse, with one sign-in per tab (on `main` by fast-forward once
> its push run read green). The page stays switched off until XC-151 and XC-152 are done. Below
> it, "What moved on 2026-10-06: b2b slice 2, signing in with wl.works", lets a wl.works member
> sign in at a rig's https page and act as themselves. Below that, "What moved on 2026-10-05: b2b slice 1, who
> did it is an actor", makes every `by` a typed name from the box or a wl.works member. Below
> that, "What moved on 2026-10-02: b2b designed", is the design both slices build. Below
> that, "What moved on 2026-10-02: XC-026, a stranded
> session resumed", lets a crashed `wlx taskd` session be resumed from its record with its numbers,
> its out-of-cage clock and its fluid carried on (on `main` by fast-forward once its CI read green).
> Below it, "What moved on 2026-10-01: run markers, and the
> plan retired", sends wl-preproc's run escape and marker and drops the unplanned-run label. Below it,
> "What moved on 2026-10-01: session levels",
> is the PI's vocabulary, ten position numbers on every trial line, block markers in the
> recording, schema 12 and the two-cell strip (on `main` by fast-forward once its CI read green).
> Below it, the eight-hour correction and the port race CI failed on, both 2026-10-01. Below them,
> "What moved on 2026-09-30, XC-155", describes every trial framed and numbered in the recording (on `main` since 2026-10-01, by fast-forward
> once its CI read green). Below it, also dated 2026-09-30, P4d-2b slices b3a-2 (the page's forms for the
> session service, and the hand reward between runs) and b3a-1 (the session service `wlx taskd`),
> each approved by the PI that day and on `main`. The entry before them, 2026-09-29, covers the
> package rename, check 8 failing closed and direct view part 2. Run
> `git branch --show-current` before believing a line about a branch.
>
> **Earlier, 2026-09-20:** `p4d1-console-link` was reviewed, approved by the
> PI and **fast-forwarded onto `main`**, which moved `300d7d1` → `08adfa2`
> and now carries P4b and P4d-1 together. The warning that sat here then — that this file
> described a branch `main` did not have — was retired because there was no divergence
> left; the note above is the same warning, back for b1 until it merges. That branch
> still exists at the same commit; nothing needs it.
>
> **Deliberately still not a commit count**: a count of a branch, stated in a
> file tracked on that branch, is wrong the instant it is committed — writing it is itself
> one more commit than it counted, and this file got that wrong three separate times
> before the number was removed rather than corrected again. Run `git log --oneline` and
> look.
>
> **That merge was a fast-forward**, so `main`'s history stays linear and every commit
> described below is reachable from it, except the b1 branch's until it merges.
> `git branch --show-current` still costs nothing before believing the rest.
>
> **P4b's CI history is worth keeping.** Its first run failed (`34769913502`,
> 2026-09-13): pytest green on all three Pythons, mutation gate red on `calibration` and
> `saccade`. Not survivors — the harness could not find two functions. Fixed 2026-09-19;
> see "What moved" and trap 7's seventh entry.

**The lab opens January 2027.** Everything is being built before any rig exists.

> **"January validates rather than discovers" was the working assumption and it is
> false.** Review caught it on 2026-08-31: it is load-bearing, because it justifies
> spending effort on the task layer instead of on the four things that must work on
> day one — **DIO out, gaze in, a frame on screen, reward out**. Two exist and are
> proven without hardware (`dio.py`, `eye.py`); **reward out is now built up to the
> pump** (`welfare.py`: a task's `Reward` reaches a delivery, the day is accounted, the
> shortfall against its floor is reported) and stops there, because turning millilitres
> into solenoid open time is a calibration nobody has measured. The display is blocked
> on a panel, the real card on a card, and the last inch of the reward line on a
> measurement. Until a rig runs all four end to end, **January discovers.** Sequence
> accordingly.

Nothing here has touched hardware.

## Read this much, and no more

**19 specs, 8 ADRs and 14 other documents exist. Do not read them all.** Counted from
disk on 2026-09-19 (`ls docs/superpowers/specs/*.md`, and `ADR-*.md` less the template);
before that, three figures here and in `next-session.md` had disagreed with each other and
with the directory. The ADR figure moved because ADR-0008 was accepted, and the "other"
figure was one low. In order:

1. **This file** — where things are.
2. **`docs/backlog.md`** — everything open, one line per item (since 2026-09-28). An
   item goes in when it is deferred and its line goes when it closes.
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — the conventions. Seventeen, and the ones that cost the most to
   learn are near the bottom: prove a test can fail, ship a safety component with its
   consumer, and treat a "not yet" comment as a dated claim nothing can check.
4. **`docs/M0-REVIEW.md`** §3 and §4 — what is still open, and the 24 engineering
   calls made without asking.
5. **The one S-spec your package names**, from the table below. Not the others.

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-spec-map.md` maps S0–S13 if you need to find one.

## Status

**M0 signed off 2026-08-31.** Contracts frozen; code started.

| | |
|---|---|
| Tests | **2037 at the tip of `xc155-trial-markers`**, 2026-10-01, `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`, rebased onto `d409077` (2011 on its own, three runs in a row; the rebase brought the function-shard gate's 26). **2017 at the tip of `ci-function-shards`**, 2026-09-30. **1991 at the tip of `p4d2b-b3a2-page-sessions`**, 2026-09-30, `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`, three runs in a row (1862 at its base). **1862 at the tip of `p4d2b-b3a1-session-service`**, 2026-09-30, `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`, three runs in a row (1557 at its base). **1557 at the tip of `direct-view-part2`**, 2026-09-29, `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1` (1508 at the rename, 1522 with check 8 failing closed). **1508, green, at b2a's fast-forward to `main`**, 2026-09-28 ~23:15 UTC: the rebased branch's push run `36481392821` (3.11–3.13) and its full sweep `36481397471` (the CI row). **1201** on `main` just before it, `952cf10` (wl-preproc's rename followed: 102 caught in its gate, all `N failed`). **1134** at `324de1c`, 2026-09-28 (CI run `36393409937`: pytest on 3.11–3.13, and the gate over `calibration`, `gaze` and `geometry`, 43 caught, every one `N failed`) — 1092 at b1's fast-forward on 2026-09-27, 1124 with the CI split's gate tests, 1127 with the `--changed-only` selection fix, 1134 with the stereoscope geometry for the 26.5-inch panel; **763 before it — with `.[dev,contract,console]` installed.** P4d-2a was approved by the PI and fast-forwarded on 2026-09-26 (`0c18827`). The residual round and the deterministic Ctrl-C test took it from 761. The final review's fix round, 2026-09-26, took it from 740 to 761; its own mutation checks read `scheduler.record` **67 failed** (it had timed out), `welfare.steady_seconds`, `SessionClock.now` and `SessionClock.__init__` **58 failed** each, and `welfare.approaching_limit` **9 failed**, each failing set checked by name for the tests it is about (see "What moved on 2026-09-26, afternoon"). **CI's gate on that push (run `36265291974`) found what the local checks did not**: `cli._interrupted`, a helper the round added, **survived** (`761 passed`), because no test read the line an interrupted run ends on. Two assertions now pin both of its branches (`3 failed`), and CI on that fix (`cd3a83b`, run `36267879930`) is green: `761 passed` on all three Pythons, and the gate re-swept `cli` at 20 caught, 0 survivors. P4d-2a's gate before that, 2026-09-26, over `cli`, `gaze`, `link`, `record`, `taskd` and `welfare`: **110 caught, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 1 NOT MUTABLE** (`welfare.emit`), every baseline and restore at 739, and every line a real `N failed` once one timeout (`taskd._publish`) had been turned into a failing test and `taskd` re-swept. The 740th test pins a gap the harness could not see (`Session.duration_warning` during the loop); see "What moved on 2026-09-26, afternoon". Before that, 682 on `main` (674 before `tools/mutate.py` learned to name what failed, 2026-09-26; 610 before the PI's round-3 rulings of 2026-09-20 and the review of them; 560 before round 2) (`p4d1-console-link`; `p4b-session-management` alone is 383). **The extras qualifier is not decoration.** P4d-1 added the `console` extra (pyzmq, msgpack) and, until 2026-09-19, neither CI job installed it: measured with both imports blocked, **9 tests fail** — `tests/test_link.py` ×7 and `tests/test_cli.py::test_wlx_run_with_link_{lets_a_real_console_attach,closes_it_when_the_session_ends}` — so the count was a statement about a developer machine and not about CI. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now installs `console` on both jobs. `bounds` and `welfare` are mutation-clean under the *fixed* harness; see trap 7's sixth and seventh entries for why that qualifier keeps needing to be re-earned. `link.py`/`taskd.py`/`cli.py` (P4d-1) re-swept after the whole-branch review's fixes, 2026-09-19 — **38 target names, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 0 NOT MUTABLE**, every baseline and restore at 438 passed, read from the harness's output and not its exit code. **Re-swept again after the PI's decisions and the review round that followed, 2026-09-19**, over `bounds`, `taskd`, `link`, `cli` and `record` — **52 target names, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 0 NOT MUTABLE**, every baseline and restore at the then-current count, and every line a real `N failed` rather than an `N errors in 0.Ns` (trap 7). **Swept a third time after the welfare-clock rulings**, over `welfare`, `bounds`, `taskd` and `scheduler` at a 467 baseline — **54 target names, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 0 NOT MUTABLE, 0 timeouts**. That run *found* two things rather than confirming them (an uncalled `Session.returned_to_cage`, and two `timed out` lines that were real gaps); both are fixed and both are written up below. **Swept a fourth time after the PI's round-2 rulings, 2026-09-20**, over `welfare`, `bounds`, `taskd`, `cli` and `link` at a 602 baseline — **72 target names, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 0 timeouts, 1 NOT MUTABLE** (`welfare.emit`, a `Protocol` stub whose body is `...`), every baseline and restore at 602, and every line a real `N failed` rather than an `N errors in 0.Ns` (trap 7). **And a fifth time after the review of those rulings**, over the three modules that changed (`welfare`, `bounds`, `cli`) at a 609 baseline — **38 target names, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 0 timeouts, 1 NOT MUTABLE**, plus `taskd.head_released` at 610 once the console-path test landed (**3 failed**, up from 2). That run is also where `_hours_minutes` went from **1 failure to 4**: the review found its only test asserted `0 hours 0 minutes`, which is the one value a function that had stopped working would also produce. **Swept a sixth time after the PI's round-3 rulings, 2026-09-20**, over `welfare`, `bounds`, `cli`, `record` and `taskd` at a 664 baseline — **77 target names, 0 survivors on the final pass, 0 timeouts, 1 SKIPPED** (`welfare.emit`, the documented `Protocol` stub), every line a real `N failed`. **That run found something**: `taskd.Session.return_needs_confirmation` **survived**, a passthrough nothing called, written for symmetry with the departure's. Deleted rather than tested — the rule is enforced by the mark itself — and `welfare._refuse_unconfirmed`'s 2 failures were checked by name to be two *behavioural* tests rather than the §5.2d bookkeeping one. **Re-swept after the review of those rulings at a 674 baseline**, all five modules — **78 target names, 0 survivors, 0 timeouts, 1 SKIPPED**. Three of the five were first read through a `tail` that truncated them, which hides a survivor by construction, and were re-run with complete output rather than trusted |
| CI | **The first function-sharded full sweep, 2026-10-01 (`workflow_dispatch` run `36772764563` on `ci-function-shards` at `6e48233`), read shard by shard: green.** 566 functions in twelve shards of 47-48, **564 caught, 0 survived**, the two NOT MUTABLE the protocol stubs `welfare.emit` and `run.display`, and all 40 baselines and restores at `2017 passed`; the shards took **1h39m to 2h26m** (b3a-2's six-way module sweep of 395 functions took 2h26m to 3h33m). `serve.__init__` reads `139 failed ... 41 errors`, a real catch with errors beside it, as before. **14 catches are timeouts**: `link._encode_command`, `_telemetry_from`, `decode`, `deliver`, `publish`, `receive`; `serve._send_frame`, `offer`, `start`; `service.step`; `taskd._publish`, `publish`; `scheduler.record`; `simulate.signal`. Only `link._encode_command` was new, and **it was run again locally with no limit: `56 failed` in 236 s**, `tests/test_link.py`'s socket tests among them, none a hang; the other thirteen were each verified the same way in b3a-2's entry or are XC-140's and `simulate.signal`'s known ones. XC-140's class. **b2a's full sweep, 2026-09-28 (`workflow_dispatch` run `36481397471` on the rebased branch), read shard by shard: green.** 25 modules, **450 caught, 0 survived**, every baseline and restore at `1508 passed`. Two lines are not a plain `N failed`: `simulate.signal`'s known timeout, and **`scheduler.record`'s new one**, a real catch locally (`84 failed` in 165 s) that CI's slower runners carry past 300 s (XC-140). The two NOT MUTABLE are protocol stubs, `welfare.emit` and `run.display`. **`--changed-only` fixed, 2026-09-28 (`334f6db`)**: a push whose diff held a `GLOBAL` file or a `tasks/` path returned an **empty** selection, so the modules it changed directly went unswept too -- the b2a plan's pre-flight found it, since that branch touches `pyproject.toml` and eight modules. It now sweeps those modules and their own test files beside the shared path, still never escalates, and says so (`tests/test_mutation_gate.py`, 53 tests; red 3 failed before the fix). CI on the fix (run on `fix-changed-only-selection`) was green and read `swept: changed modules and their own test files`. **The first sharded nightly ran 2026-09-28 (run `36406656838`, on `046a56c`), read line by line: green.** GitHub started it at 09:56 UTC, six and a half hours after its 03:17 slot. Its six `mutation-full` shards took 58-76 minutes each, well under the 360-minute job ceiling that forced the split: 25 modules, **374 caught, 0 survived, 0 skipped**, and every baseline and restore at `1134 passed`. Two lines are not a plain `N failed`. `simulate.signal` `timed out after 300s` is the same entry written up on 2026-09-20. `serve.__init__` reads `59 failed ... 13 errors`, a real catch with errors beside it, as the b2a pre-flight saw locally. `serve.start`, `offer` and `_send_frame`, which ran near the limit alone in that pre-flight, did not time out in CI. **Split, 2026-09-27, on `main` since `c215a10`** (PI, "both"). Its first CI run, on its own branch (run `36325881803`, a first push with an all-zero `before`, so the gate diffed against `origin/main`), read: `mutation gate: 0 module(s)`, pytest green on 3.11–3.13, `mutation-full` skipped -- the push check took seconds, not hours. The full sweep had reached 25 modules, about 375 functions (ast-counted; the docstring's "about 420" is the older, rounder figure) and roughly six hours on a CI runner -- the b1 push (run `36309285075`) was still going past four hours -- against GitHub's own default job timeout of 360 minutes when a job sets none, which none here had (GitHub Actions documentation, `jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes`, read 2026-09-27). Two changes: `tools/mutation_gate.py` gained **`--changed-only`** (a push or PR selects only the modules its own diff can have affected and **never escalates on GLOBAL** -- it prints that it did not and that the nightly covers it, so the log does not read like a full check) and **`--shard K/N`** (the selected modules split into `N` deterministic groups, balanced by function count rather than module count, since `serve.py` alone has 38 functions to `components.py`'s 1). `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `mutation` (push, pull_request) now runs `--changed-only`; a new `mutation-full` matrix (`schedule`, and a new `workflow_dispatch` trigger -- the "run the full sweep now" button) runs `--all --shard K/6` six ways, `fail-fast: false`, each shard its own checkout. Today's 25 modules split 62-63 functions per shard. Guarded by `tests/test_mutation_gate.py`, 47 tests (18 before): the partition and balance properties for `N` 1-8, determinism across calls, both `--changed-only` directions, and four bad `--shard` values refused with a message -- each new test proved able to fail by a temporary reverted mutation, and the file run green three times in a row. **Not measured**: no shard has actually run in CI, so this makes no runtime claim past the ceiling it exists to stay under (CLAUDE.md's "no timing claim without a measurement" -- the next session's first nightly or `workflow_dispatch` run is that measurement). **A branch that wants its full check before merging without waiting for 03:17 UTC** uses the `workflow_dispatch` button (the same sharded matrix the nightly runs), or, without six parallel Actions jobs, a local sweep run as parallel lanes in separate `git archive` copies of the tree -- copies rather than one worktree, because the harness mutates a module's file in place and a shared tree cannot run two lanes at once. **The nightly of 2026-09-25 failed with nothing changed** (run `36115579357`) — on a flaky test, not a survivor, and the harness could not say which; see "What moved on 2026-09-26". The four nightlies before it (09-21 to 09-24) are green. **`main` took the fast-forward of `p4d1-console-link` on 2026-09-20 (`08adfa2`).** Its three pytest legs are green. Its `mutation` job escalated to the **full** sweep, and the reason is worth knowing before reading a push's gate output: a push's gate base is the *previous* `main`, so the whole 55-commit range was in its changed set, `tasks/` included, and it re-ran the sweep that had already passed on `31a3283`. **It finished green (run `35515487242`, 1h55m), read rather than trusted on 2026-09-26**: 22 modules, 264 caught, **0 survivors, 0 skips**, all 44 baselines and restores at `674 passed` — and the five catches that are not a real `N failed` are the four `geometry` imports and `simulate.signal`'s timeout written up under 2026-09-20. **And do not read `main`'s tip run as that check**: `f3ccfe5` is docs-only, so its gate selected **0 modules** (`mutation gate: 0 module(s)`, `selected: (none)`) and passed in three minutes. It is green and it swept nothing, which is the whole reason this row says to read the output. Before that: **green on `main` through `300d7d1`**, verified 2026-09-06 by reading the runs rather than the workflow: six consecutive successes, the `wl-preproc` checkout syncing, `307 passed` with no skips and `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1` in force. **P4b failed in CI on 2026-09-13 and is green as of 2026-09-19.** The 09-13 run (`34769913502`) escalated to a full sweep as predicted, took 1h46m, and reported `MUTATION GATE FAILED: calibration, saccade` — two functions the harness could not find rather than two survivors (trap 7, seventh entry). Run `35433303094` on `afc7d04` is the fix, **verified by reading its log rather than its exit code**: 21 modules, 215 caught, **0 survivors and 0 skips**, `383 passed` at every baseline, and the four functions the commit was about each reporting a real failure — `recenter 5 failed`, `detect 7 failed`, `_XYZ 4 failed`, `FixPoint 4 failed`. The nightly schedule runs on `main`, which **now contains both P4b and P4d-1**, so from 2026-09-21 its greens describe them — until the merge they did not, and this sentence sat here saying so for six days. pytest on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13, plus a **mutation gate**. Selective since 2026-09-05: `tools/mutation_gate.py` runs the modules a change can have affected and escalates to all of them on anything structural, with the **full sweep nightly** — the per-push gate cannot see a test deleted from one file that was the only cover for a function in another. It refuses to run at all if a module is in neither its gated nor its exempt list. Functions that already return immediately are reported `NOT MUTABLE` rather than counted as survivors (trap 7) |
| Welfare-critical modules | **two modules, `bounds.py` and `welfare.py`, and since P4d-2a four functions in `cli.py`, plus one line inside a fifth, beside them.** `bounds` is pure limits — ceilings, and a daily **floor**; `welfare` holds the day's total, the two clocks (out-of-cage, which bounds the session; restraint, which is recorded), the wall they are read on (`SessionClock`, moved in from `taskd` by P4d-2a's final review because it decides the interval), the pump, and `Rig` — the object a task's `Reward` action actually reaches. **The four `cli` functions are `_wall_clock_time`, `_clock_or_now`, `_settle_return` and `_settle_departure`** (the last added in the residual fix round before the PI's welfare review): they parse the times an operator types into the instants that bound the out-of-cage interval, and `_settle_departure` also decides `confirmed=` for the departure, which `welfare._refuse_unconfirmed` trusts its caller on — so a plausible mistake there passes every refusal `welfare` has (`docs/design/architecture.md` has the list and why). **The fifth is `main` itself**, for its one line `session.left_cage(at=departure, confirmed=note is not None, ...)`, which carries `_settle_departure`'s decision into `welfare` unchanged. **All of it requires human review before merge** (CLAUDE.md, S8 §7). All of it moved in P4d-2a, which the PI approved on 2026-09-26. **P4d-2b b2a added, approved by the PI on 2026-09-28:** five `taskd` functions (`Session._ends`, `_hold`, `_manual_reward`, `set` and `_schedule`), two parts of `Session._command` (its `held` pass-through and one `except` line), and `link._setting` (`architecture.md` has why). **P4d-2b b3a-1 added, approved by the PI on 2026-09-30:** `marks.py` and `stranded.py` whole (the departure and return decisions moved out of `cli`, which keeps `_settle_departure`, `_settle_return` and `main`'s `_marks.depart` line), `Welfare.restore_departure`, `preflight.out_of_cage` and `preflight.gate`, and seven `service.py` functions (`Service._open`, `_end` with `_unended`, `_close_stranded`, `_start`, `_unasked`, `_folder_name`). `_Routed.drain` and `preflight.unmeasured` were proposed at its final review and **taken back off by the PI**. **P4d-2b b3a-2 changed, approved by the PI on 2026-09-30, and added nothing:** `taskd.Session._manual_reward` decides by phase (a hand reward between runs and while the return is awaited in a `wlx taskd` session; its phases are `taskd.OUTSIDE_A_RUN`, part of its rule), `Session._command`'s reward pass-through moved first (the line unchanged) and one sentence, and `welfare.Welfare._far_from_now`'s words for a far return. **b2b slice 1 changed, approved by the PI on 2026-10-05, and added nothing:** `by` in the listed functions is an actor (`actor.Box` or `actor.Member`) written as its map, and `stranded.Restored.returned_to_cage`'s default is `None`; no rule moved |
| Fluid | **A floor, not a ceiling** (PI, 2026-09-06). The daily figure is a minimum the animal must reach, topped up by hand after the session; **no delivery is ever refused on volume**. Only the per-delivery magnitude is a ceiling. S8 §4–§5 were written the other way round and now carry the correction |
| Session duration | **One limit: out of the cage to back in the cage, twelve hours** (PI, 2026-09-19). Chair time and a trial cap were the two ceilings until then; neither is a limit now — chair time is recorded by `HEAD_FIXED`/`HEAD_RELEASED` and there is no session-length maximum at all. A rig session is **refused** without its out-of-cage mark; a cage-side one declares `welfare.Deployment.CAGE_SIDE` and has no duration bound. Eight hours, the institution's limit, is documented (S8 §5.2 item 4, `welfare.py`) and carried by no constant; the twelve recorded until 2026-10-01 was wrong (PI, 2026-10-01). **Since 2026-09-20 (PI)** **both marks** are **clock times** (`--out-of-cage-at`, and the return). **With P4d-2a (spec §10, approved by the PI 2026-09-26 and on `main`), both ends of the interval are wall instants and every welfare duration is read on the wall**: `Session.wall_now()`, the wall read once when the session is created (`welfare.SessionClock`) and carried forward on a **steady clock that counts suspend** (`welfare.steady_seconds` — `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` on Linux, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on macOS, both documented to keep counting while the host sleeps; `time.monotonic()` elsewhere, which does not, and says so) rather than on plain `time.monotonic()`, since P4d-2a's final review (I1) found a suspend during a session undercounted the interval on the unsafe side. The frame clock times trials only, so the unchairing and the walk back are inside the limit with nothing mapped. **The return is taken at `wlx run`'s terminal, the stand-in until the wl-works ELN records both ends** (PI, 2026-09-26). With no terminal, linked or not, `wlx run` records `return not recorded (no terminal)` and exits. Both ends are rows in `welfare_notes.jsonl`, and the out-of-cage clock is published after the loop until the return. A separate **in-session clock** (session opened to session ended) is published and recorded, and bounds nothing. A mark **more than thirty minutes from now is confirmed by a person or amended with a reason and a name** (`welfare.CONFIRM_MARK_WITHIN`; `wlx run` refuses rather than proceeding when no terminal is attached), there are **three deployment kinds** — `RIG_FIXED`, `RIG_CHAIRED`, `CAGE_SIDE` — with restraint reported **absent rather than zero** where nothing marks it, and the session **warns** at `welfare.WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT` (1,800 s, **accepted by the PI on 2026-09-20 as a starting value** and still derived from no measurement of this system) before the limit |
| Reference tasks | `fixation_detection`, `adaptive_detection`, `visual_search` (colour pop-out, set size 2–12), `calibration` |
| Load-time checks | **9 of S1 §9's 10, plus S1a's window check, plus nine added after review 2026-08-31** (`uncoupled-window`, `nothing-to-look-at`, `absent-stimulus`, `duplicate-stimulus`, `empty-update`, `uncalibrated-color`, `unrealizable-color`, `overspecified-color`, `unstated-observer`, `target-outside-array`, `impossible-correlation`, `monocular-stereogram`, `unknown-eye`, `wrong-eye-criterion`).** **Plus direct view's three** (part 1, 2026-09-28): `needs-stereoscope`, `wrong-setup`, `unknown-view`; **and since part 2 (2026-09-29) check 8 and the setup check run against the session's own field** in `taskd` and `wlx check`, where before only the tests passed one. Check 7 is enforced for reward and *not* for stimulation, because no `Stim` action exists yet. Corrected 2026-08-31 after review caught the count |

What is missing on that leg is a **pump calibration** — millilitres per second of open time — which nobody has measured |

### What exists

- `task.py` — the declarative trial: states, guarded transitions, actions, parameters.
- `check.py` — the load-time checks. Check 8 runs *per eye, after disparity*:
  a stimulus inside the cyclopean field can still put one eye's image outside it.
- `geometry.py` — the split-screen field, derived from S0 §5.2's formula with tests
  asserting agreement with the optics drawing.
- `review.py` + `wlx review` — the artifact a task is approved from: Mermaid diagram,
  event-code table **named by transition**, a **display timeline**, window coupling
  and eye, parameter ranges, what needs human review, stimuli.
- `photometry.py` — colour as a physical claim: CIE xyY and DKL cone contrast,
  checked against a measured `Calibration`. **No calibration for our panels exists**,
  so chromatic tasks will not load until one is committed under `docs/measurements/`.
- `eye.py` — OpenIrisDPI's UDP protocol (`WAITFORDATA` on 9003), P1−P4 as the gaze
  signal, hold-last with a 50 ms staleness ceiling. Tested over a loopback socket.
- `dio.py` — the breakout's pin map: 16 event bits on **P0.8–P0.23**, strobe, reward,
  stim trigger, four inputs. `Absent`, `Simulated` and the real card as peers.
- `tasks/` — three reference tasks (`fixation_detection`, `adaptive_detection`,
  `visual_search`) and the reference allocation. `wl-exptasks`' to
  own eventually; here until it exists.
- `encode.py` — the 16-bit strobed word stream. Round-trips through `wl-preproc`'s
  own `decode_stream` and matches their `encode_payload` exactly across the uint32
  range. **We deliberately write no decoder.**
- `run.py` — the trial loop. Hardware, behaviour agents and demo mode are peers the
  loop cannot distinguish. **`Effects` is the outbound half**, added 2026-09-06: a
  world answers questions, and marks and rewards answer none, so they leave through a
  separate port. The default `Unwired` **refuses**, because for five days `_apply`
  executed the display actions and silently discarded the other two.
- `simulate.py` — the census: outcomes, states visited, hangs, and outcomes nothing
  reached. `Tally` is shared with `taskd`, so a census counts the same things whether
  it came from an exhaustive walk of a task or from a session under its ceilings.
- `cli.py` — `wlx check`, `wlx review`, `wlx run`, `wlx console`; exit 1 on a blocking
  finding. `wlx run` needs `--bounds`, `--rig` and `--view` (and, in the stereoscope,
  `--subject-settings`), refuses a task that fails its checks in that setup before anything
  is recorded, reports what it commanded and why it stopped,
  and takes an optional `--link PUB,REP` that opens a console link (nothing acquires
  the transport dependency when it is omitted). `wlx console --sub PUB --req REP --as
  WHO` attaches to a running session, renders each `Telemetry` frame (S9a §4's panes:
  fluid, chair, trials, still owed, staged, refused) and can `--set NAME=VALUE` or
  `--stop` it. `wlx run` had **no test at all** until 2026-09-06, which is how a
  subcommand ends up unable to construct the object it exists to construct.
- `link.py` — the console link: the telemetry message and its schema (`Telemetry`,
  `Staged`, `Refused`, `SCHEMA`), the commands a console sends back (`SetParameter`,
  `Stop`), the port a session drains and publishes through (`Link`, `Absent`,
  `Simulated` as peers, exactly as in `dio.py`), and the one live transport
  (`ZmqLink`/`ZmqConsole`, ZMQ PUB/SUB + REQ/REP, msgpack, per ADR-0003). Drained and
  published **once per trial boundary, never per frame** — S9 §1's hot-loop rule,
  proved by a test rather than only argued. **S9a §9's one rule, enforced structurally
  rather than by care**: every `Telemetry` field is read from `welfare`, `tally` or
  `scheduler`, never recomputed, and unknown is `None`, never a confident `0`. **Not
  welfare-critical, and built to stay that way** — it carries no ceiling, no clock and
  no pump; the welfare-critical surface stays exactly `bounds.py` and `welfare.py`.
  Added 2026-09-19 (P4d-1). Three things this slice found and deliberately left open
  are recorded in "What moved on 2026-09-19" below.
- `taskd.py` — **the session**: blocks from `scheduler`, criterion transitions,
  ceilings that end a run, one validated path for live parameter writes, and the
  world as an injectable seam. A flat run of N trials is the block session with one
  block, not a second loop.
- `tasks/reference_bounds.py` — a bounded config for `wlx run` and for reading.
  **Every number in it is a placeholder**; its subject is `REFERENCE`, and a session
  refuses a bounded config belonging to another subject, so it cannot quietly become
  a real one. The one number that is *not* implausibly small is `reward_correct`'s
  maximum, 10 mL: a runaway-fluid fault bound rather than a dose cap (PI, 2026-09-19).
- **`bounds.py` — welfare-critical, and pure.** Ceilings a task cannot express and a
  console cannot exceed, **and a daily fluid floor** — a minimum, not a budget. Fluid
  reconciled against the delivered line rather than what we commanded. No clock, no
  hardware, no state that outlives a question. `Floor` and `Ceiling` are different
  types so the two cannot be confused at a call site, which is exactly how the daily
  figure came to be compared with `>`. **`validate` and `set` are separate calls**
  (2026-09-19) because a change is checked when it is offered and applied a boundary
  later; `set` goes through `validate`, so the rule has one home. **Requires human
  review before merge**.
- **`welfare.py` — welfare-critical, and the caller.** The day's fluid total including
  what another deployment already delivered, the restraint clock started by
  head-fixation, the `Pump` port, and **`Rig` — the object a task's `Reward` action
  actually reaches.** `shortfall()` is what a session hands a person at close: how much
  of the day's minimum is still owed. The whole route from a task's declaration to fluid
  is readable in this one file, which is the property to keep. Added 2026-09-06 because
  limits alone were not enough. **Requires human review before merge.**
- `calibration.py` — raw Purkinje vector to degrees, per eye. The model and the file
  are both **wl-preproc's**, read from their source; ours is the procedure. Thirteen
  targets (measured, not chosen), three refusals in a deliberate order — count, then
  conditioning, then extent — and a YAML file round-tripped through their real reader
  in CI. `EyeMap.degrees` is the trial-loop path and allocates nothing.
- `findings.py` — the `Finding` dataclass, lifted out of `check.py` so `calibration`
  can report refusals in the same words without a circular import.
- `saccade.py` — online Engbert-Kliegl, and the batch form it is checked against.
  The algorithm is **`wl-preproc`'s**, chosen by S5 §5 precisely so online-versus-
  offline disagreement measures staleness and latency rather than two methods — and
  a contract test proves ours finds *the same intervals theirs finds*, which is what
  that argument actually rests on. Per-trial adaptive threshold, the S5 §5 stall rule,
  and a detection whose window touched a gap is flagged rather than dropped.
- `gaze.py` — **the join**: `eye.Tracker` + a versioned `Mapping` + a trial's windows,
  behind `run.World`. Replayed OpenIrisDPI payloads reach a `Window` test in degrees,
  which is P6's exit condition. Polls the tracker in `display`, the loop's only
  per-frame call that lands before the frame's guards. `SaccadeOnset` and `SaccadeTo`
  are **different events**: onset fires at confirmation, while the eye is still in
  flight and has landed nowhere; `SaccadeTo` waits for the run to close and then asks
  where. A saccade is consumed by whichever guard takes it, or one saccade becomes a
  stream of them.
- `tasks/calibration.py` — the calibration block, written in the ordinary task
  vocabulary. It passes every load-time check with zero findings, which is the
  finding: the vocabulary can express its own calibration.
- `tools/mutate.py` — proves a test can fail. Read its docstring before trusting a
  mutation result by hand, and **read its output rather than its exit code**: it has
  been wrong six times, and the sixth reported `caught` on the strength of a syntax
  error (trap 7).
- `tools/calibration_design.py` — which constellation the block should present, and
  why. Results in `docs/measurements/dev-machine/2026-09-05-calibration-constellation.md`.

### What does not exist, and matters

- ~~**`taskd` is a spine, not a daemon**, and never imports `scheduler.py`~~ and
  ~~**`bounds.check_delivery` is called by nothing outside its own tests**~~ —
  **both closed 2026-09-06**, and what they were is now pitfall P21. See "What moved"
  below.
- ~~**`taskd` is still not a daemon.** There is no console link over a socket~~ —
  **closed 2026-09-19 (P4d-1).** `Session.link` drains commands into `Session.set` and
  publishes telemetry, once per trial boundary, over a real ZMQ socket (`link.py`'s
  `ZmqLink`/`ZmqConsole`); `wlx console` is a terminal client for it. Still missing:
  the browser client and HTTP/WS server ADR-0008 chose, and the `labhost` surface that
  rides on it (P4d-2); the actor split (P4d-3), whose types exist since b2b slice 1
  (2026-10-05: `by` is an `actor.Box` or an `actor.Member`), though nothing signs a member in
  until slice 2; and `rt_approx_ms` (P4d-4). **Pre-flight under S9a
  §10's rule is built for `wlx taskd`'s runs since b3a-1 (2026-09-30, `preflight.py`)**;
  `wlx run` still takes none (XC-159).
- **Nothing converts millilitres to solenoid open time.** `welfare.Pump` takes
  millilitres because that is what the ceilings are denominated in; the conversion is
  a **per-rig pump calibration that has never been measured**, so the driver that
  opens copper does not exist and would be inventing a dose if it did. `wl-sync`'s
  board one-shots the *manual* button at ~199 ms and passes our commanded line through
  its OR gate untouched (their `hardware/README.md`, 2026-08-15 entry), so the pulse
  width is ours to choose — which is exactly why the number matters. New open
  measurement; see below.
- **A live parameter change is not on the recording clock**, only in the session
  record. `PARAM_CHANGE` is an *escape* carrying a uint32 sequence number and
  `wl-preproc` has not agreed the amendment, so `PARAM_CHANGED` (4130) marks the
  timing in our own range and the values sit beside it in
  `parameter_changes.jsonl`. Strictly better than the silence P16 warns about and
  strictly worse than the escape: two changes in one interval are told apart by order
  alone, and a dropped code desynchronises that ordering in a way a sequence number
  would survive.
- **Calibration is a whole session, not an interlude.** S8 §1 wants sub-tasks a
  session enters and leaves without ending; `gaze.Calibrating` drives a session whose
  *task* is the calibration block. Switching task mid-session is the interlude, and it
  does not exist.
- **Parquet is not written.** JSONL is the durable streamed record; the columnar
  table is a derivation at session close that does not exist yet. Deliberate: a
  Parquet file is only valid once closed, so it cannot be the crash-safe record.
- **CI is green, 2026-09-05 — for the first time ever.** Of 28 runs in this
  repository's history, exactly one has passed, and it is the one after the fixes
  below. Everything in this entry was found in five runs on one afternoon, after
  four days in which nothing was pushed and every claim about CI was therefore
  about a thing that had never executed.

- ~~**CI is red, has been since 2026-08-31, and nothing since has been pushed.**~~
  Established 2026-09-05 by reading the runs rather than the workflow file. Three
  facts, each of which was believed otherwise:
  - The last pushed run (`33439705522`) fails with **three survivors in the mutation
    gate** — `words_for`, `words_for_code` and `_checksum`. They are caught by the
    codec round-trip alone, and the round-trip was skipping (`1 skipped`) because
    that job had no `wl-preproc`. A mutation gate running without its contract tests
    reports that tests can fail while the ones that would have failed did not run.
  - **`main` is 18 commits ahead of `origin/main`.** Everything from 2026-09-01 and
    2026-09-05 — including the 09-01 fix that added the checkout to the test job —
    has never run in CI at all. The fix was believed to be in force for four days.
  - **That fix would not have worked.** It used `path: ../wl-preproc`, and
    `actions/checkout` resolves `path` against `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and **throws** on
    anything that escapes it (verified 2026-09-05 against `src/input-helper.ts`
    lines 40–53 in `actions/checkout`, not against its README). Corrected to a path
    inside the workspace, with `tests/conftest.py` searching both locations.

  **Green, 2026-09-05**, verified by watching the runs rather than by reading the
  workflow. The three encoder mutations that had been surviving since 2026-08-31 --
  `words_for`, `words_for_code`, `_checksum` -- are caught now that the round-trip
  actually executes, which is the first evidence that gate ever worked. One further
  survivor surfaced with it: **`review._scores_label` was covered by no test**, so
  the artifact's window-coupling column -- which stimulus each window scores, and
  whether it is `REMEMBERED` or nothing at all -- rendered unchecked. Trap 11 again,
  and found only because the gate finally ran. A second run then surfaced
  `Unchanged.__repr__`, uncovered -- **newly visible rather than newly broken**: trap
  7 records that the harness's old pattern could not match
  `def __repr__(self) -> str:  # pragma: no cover`, so it had been skipped in
  silence. Fixing the pattern made it reachable and CI made it audible. Resolved by
  testing the sentinel rather than by teaching the harness to honour the pragma,
  because a category of exemption anyone can open with a comment is this tool's
  sixth failure waiting to happen.

- **CI green with the selective gate, 2026-09-05.** `bounds` and `scheduler` have
  now been mutation-tested in CI for the first time, and the run that did it
  escalated to all nineteen modules because the workflow itself had changed --
  which is the escalation rule working rather than a coincidence.

  **A full sweep costs 47-61 minutes** (read off GitHub's own run durations for runs
  `33963919596`, `33966768083`, `33971576019`, `33972113194` on 2026-09-05 -- not a
  claim about the rig, and not from `tools/`). That is per push, and it grows with
  every module and every test, which is why the gate became selective rather than
  merely faster.

  **That figure is stale, and the direction is the point.** Two full sweeps since, read
  the same way: `34769913502` took **1h46m** on 2026-09-13, and `35433303094` took
  **1h39m** on 2026-09-19. The second is the faster one *despite* eight more tests and
  two more functions on the target lists, because those lists lost their duplicates. The
  figure to carry forward is **about 1h40m**, and it will keep growing with the suite.

- **Three modules were never in the CI mutation gate at all**, found when the
  hand-maintained list in the workflow was replaced by one derived from disk:
  `bounds` — **the welfare-critical module** — plus `scheduler` and `findings`. This
  file has said "a mutation gate over every module" since M0. Both `bounds` and
  `scheduler` pass a sweep, so nothing was actually wrong with them; what was wrong
  was the claim. See trap 18.

  **Pushed and watched, 2026-09-05.** Run `33956427875`: the path fix was correct and
  a **third**, independent fault was underneath it. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to this
  repository, so checking out a second private one returns `Not Found` — which is the
  token problem this file recorded in the abstract ("needs a token for a private
  repo") without connecting it to the checkout that was believed to work.

  ~~**CI is red now and stays red until someone creates a secret.**~~ **Resolved, and
  this file said otherwise for a day.** It needed a fine-grained PAT with
  `Contents: read` on `jakewesterberg/wl-preproc` as the repository secret
  `WL_PREPROC_TOKEN`; that secret exists and works.

  **Verified 2026-09-06 by reading the runs, not the workflow** (`gh run list`): the
  last six runs on `main` all succeeded, and run `33984657820`'s log shows the
  `wl-preproc` checkout syncing from the remote and `307 passed` with no skips. Both
  jobs set `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`, so a missing checkout would have *failed* rather
  than skipped — which is what makes that green mean the contract tests actually ran.
  Left as a struck-through entry rather than deleted, because "CI is red and needs a
  person" was a live ask in this file and someone should be able to see that it closed.

  The reasoning behind it stands and is why the guard is worth keeping: the round-trip
  and the calibration contract are the only checks that we emit their protocol and fit
  their model rather than our idea of either, and **a contract test that is allowed
  not to run is not a contract test.**

  Three ways of getting one checkout wrong, each of which looked fixed: no checkout,
  a path outside the workspace, and no credentials for it.

## What moved on 2026-10-07: demo mode designed and parked, and the order changed

**Resume here (state at 2026-10-07):** `main` is b2b-ready's tip plus this entry (branch
`demo-mode`, docs only). **Superseded the same day: the PI then asked to brainstorm "the engine for
running tasks" first, the display engine and the task runtime as one design** (asked which
engine: "Both, as one design"), on branch `engine-design`. The default color calibration and the
warnings list (item 1 below) are expected to land inside that design. **Where it stands
(2026-10-07, evening):** all fifteen elements were discussed with the PI, well over a hundred
questions in the UI, every answer recorded verbatim in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-engine-brainstorm-notes.md`; the umbrella spec is written,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-engine-design.md`, and two design reviews (science,
feasibility) run on it before the PI reads it. **Next:** fold the reviews in (asking the PI what is
his), the PI's review of the spec, then build A (the screen description and the slow exact
drawer); the Vulkan spike (build S) runs on the PI's Linux machine over SSH once he is home to
switch it on. Surveys: `docs/research/2026-10-07-engine-*.md`, `2026-10-07-vstimd-prior-art.md`.
The four builds the PI had ordered just before:

1. **A default color calibration, and a warnings list in the console.** The PI's words: "There
   should be a default color calibration/lut that is used when one isn't specified by the rig
   file. There should maybe also be a warnings tab in the console that lists all things that are
   imperfect, such as this, but as acceptable. E.g., for a training session, having a perfect
   color calibration is a nice to have, not a need to have." Today `check._color_faults` refuses
   every declared color with no measured calibration (`uncalibrated-color`, blocking), so
   `visual_search` loads nowhere, and the pre-flight's acknowledgeable unknowns (pump
   calibration, eye tracker) are the nearest thing to that list. Not designed yet.
2. **Trials that vary**: conditions, blocks and between-trial procedures declared by the task
   (XC-207, XC-242). Today a run is one block of one condition (`taskd._plan`), so every trial is
   the same trial, on a rig as in a demo, and nothing calls `adaptive_detection.next_params`.
3. **The reference tasks made right**, with the PI's decisions on the science review's findings
   2, 3 and 9: the staircase's rule (misses never move it; no catch trials), trials that never
   vary, `visual_search`'s `item_window` and `calibration`'s `cal_hold`. **Ask them then**, in the
   UI; they are not in the backlog because they are his.
4. **Demo mode** (XC-013), from its parked spec.

- **Demo mode was designed** with the PI on 2026-10-06, in three parts, each approved ("Looks
  right"): a simulation session in `wlx taskd` for the test monkey alone, driven by a page's
  mouse through the rig's own gaze path; the page's simulation screen; and `wlx demo`, which
  starts a private `wlx taskd` and `wlx serve` and opens the browser on the task. His rulings:
  both doors in one build, one engine behind them, `REFERENCE` alone, and `wlx demo` on
  `tasks/eight_hour_bounds.py`.
- **Two design reviews found 27 problems before any code was written**, kept as written in
  `docs/superpowers/reviews/`. The science review asked where a person checking a task would be
  misled; the feasibility review read the spec against the code. Among them: `visual_search`
  loads nowhere; appearances cannot be set by any run; the page has no recenter and no reward
  key; a still pointer gives the saccade detector no noise scale, and a one-report flick gives
  it too few samples; a crashed simulation would resume as a live session; `REFERENCE`'s
  ten-minute ceiling; a third PUB message kind breaks five readers. The spec's §14 lists every
  change to make before it goes to the PI.
- **Learned**: a domain review at the design milestone again found what no self-review would
  have (the memory "domain reviewers find real bugs" holds). Read a review's claims as claims:
  the session re-ran the ones that changed the design before acting on them.
- **Backlog**: XC-242 filed (nothing calls a task's between-trial procedure); XC-013 now waits on
  the order above.
- **wl.works deployed its 16a-1b** on 2026-10-07 (its commit `637007a7`, as its session reported):
  the 120 s renewal grace and the stricter rig-page addresses are live. XC-225 closed; XC-241 no
  longer waits.
- **XC-240 closed** the same day (branch `xc240`, on `main` at `21a9400`): `signin.parse_rig_page`
  refuses any rig-page address that is not its origin as written, with or without a final `/`,
  exactly as wl.works' `parseRigPages` does since its 16a-1b (`src/lib/rigs.ts:113` at
  `637007a7`): a query, an upper-case scheme or host, a spelled-out `:443`, a port with a leading
  zero, a non-standard IP address and a non-ASCII name are refused (`signin._canonical_host`).
  CI read job by job, on the branch (run `37605236320`) and on `main` (run `37609443120`): pytest
  `2523 passed` on 3.11-3.13; the gate swept `signin`, 22 caught, 0 survived, no timeouts,
  `redirect_request` inert, every baseline and restore at `2491 passed, 32 skipped`.

## What moved on 2026-10-06: b2b-ready, the https page safe to switch on

**Resume here (state at 2026-10-06, evening):** b2b-ready is on `main` (branch `b2b-ready`, a
fast-forward once its push run read green). It closes the eight items slice 2's review left open
(XC-224, XC-226 to XC-232). The PI approved its four-item summary ("Approve all four"; spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-b2b-ready-design.md` §8). The welfare-critical list is
unchanged. The https page still ships switched off. **Next, before any rig uses it:**
1. XC-151: a certificate and a name for each rig.
2. XC-152: the rig list sent to wl-works. It now waits on XC-151 alone.
3. XC-223: the one live check. It includes two checks by hand in Safari: *Duplicate Tab*, and
   a tab navigated away and back.

wl.works' own side, its 16a-1b, is not yet deployed. It holds the answers to the two asks
(below), and XC-225, XC-240 and XC-241 follow it. The plan:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-06-b2b-ready.md`.

- **The server half** (`wl_xcon/serve.py`, `wl_xcon/signin.py`):
  - **Nothing about the https page can stop `wlx serve`.** The PI chose this of three designs:
    "Always start the rig PC page". The http listener binds first. The https page is turned off,
    with its reason in the terminal and on the rig PC's page, by any of:
    - a missing flag;
    - the `signin` extra missing, or installed and broken;
    - a bad `--rig-page` or `--wl-works-issuer`;
    - a bad certificate or key;
    - a busy https port.
  - **wl.works is asked only after binding**, by the keys thread (`signin.Checker.keep_keys`).
    It retries every 60 s until it has keys, then fetches the key set again every 15 minutes
    (`KEY_REFRESH_S`), so a key wl.works withdraws stops being trusted.
  - **The rig says why it cannot check a sign-in** before it reads any token: wl.works was not
    reached (`NO_KEYS`), or answered as another issuer (`OTHER_ISSUER`).
- **The page half** (`web._SCRIPT`'s sign-in block, spec §4):
  - Every stuck sign-in ends at its token's lapse, with one last try, and sends nothing.
  - Only wl.works' own OAuth refusal ends a renewal. A server error is no answer.
  - The rig's `expired` acts on the token it refused.
  - A renewal the rig cannot confirm grays the controls and is asked about again every 30 s.
  - **One sign-in per tab:** a Web Lock is named by each sign-in's id. A duplicated tab's copy
    stays inert during its 1 s wait, then is forgotten, never signed out.
  - A page served without keys never renews; it asks the rig again every minute and reloads into
    the sign-in.
  - The three intervals are rendered by Python (`web.SIGNIN_RETRY_MS`, `KEYS_RECHECK_MS`,
    `SIGNIN_LOCK_WAIT_MS`), so tests shorten them.
- **The two asks to wl-works, answered 2026-10-06** (`docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`):
  yes to both, in its 16a-1b.
  - A 120 s grace for a renewal token presented twice. wl.works had already had a 30 s grace,
    through `@better-auth/mcp`; XC-225 is corrected to say so.
  - `parseRigPages` refuses any address that is not an origin. This is stricter than our
    `parse_rig_page` (XC-240).
- **Welfare-critical code: none changed.** `taskd`, `welfare`, `bounds`, `link._setting` and
  `web._hand_reward_now` are untouched, and what a member can do is exactly as approved on
  2026-10-05.
- **Learned, and worth the next session's time**:
  - **`tools/mutate.py` cannot reach `web._SCRIPT`,** which is a string. The page's rules are
    pinned by browser tests, each proven by a break by hand, in both engines.
  - **With the browser tests, the suite takes 250-305 s,** against `mutate.py`'s fixed 300 s
    limit. So the local sweep ran as CI's mutation jobs do:
    - each lane in a `git archive` copy;
    - `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` set to an empty directory, so the 32 browser tests skip;
    - about 165 s a run.
  - **WebKit is a setting.** `WLX_BROWSER=webkit` runs the browser tests in WebKit (Playwright
    1.63's WebKit 26.6, installed in this machine's Playwright cache). It went green at every
    change to the page. Safari's own *Duplicate Tab* and its back/forward cache stay checks by
    hand (XC-223).
  - **A plan's order can break its spec.** The plan bound https before http, so an https port
    that overlapped the http one refused `wlx serve`. A task review caught it, and also caught a
    dead test fixture and a mis-aimed test pin. Tasks 2, 3 and 4 each needed fix rounds. The
    final review then found two more gaps:
    - a page without keys posting the renewal token to the rig;
    - a broken `signin` extra still crashing `wlx serve`.
- **Backlog**:
  - XC-224 and XC-226 to XC-232 closed.
  - XC-233 to XC-239 filed: the final review's deferred defects, one line of test hygiene, and
    a non-`ImportError` from `jwt`.
  - XC-240 and XC-241 filed, from wl-works' answer.
  - XC-223 widened. XC-225 corrected. XC-152 waits on XC-151 alone.
  - XC-140 widened with the push gate's one new timeout, `serve.host_name`.
- **Proof, local**:
  - `2512 passed` at `c9c53c1` (about 290 s, `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1 WLX_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1`).
  - WebKit: `test_page_browser.py` 31 passed (162 s), and with `test_web.py` 228 passed.
  - A sweep of the 17 changed functions caught all 17 by a named failure, with none surviving
    and none timing out (`serve` 7, `cli.main`, `signin` 8, `web.page`). Every baseline and
    restore read `2480 passed, 32 skipped`.
- **Proof, CI on the branch's push** (run `37474027448`, on `e9e3325`), read job by job: green.
  - pytest `2512 passed` on 3.11-3.13, with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC` and `WLX_REQUIRE_BROWSER`.
  - Mutation: a first push, so the gate diffed against `origin/main` and swept `cli`, `serve`,
    `signin` and `web` whole. 12 shards, 196 functions. **195 caught, 0 survived**;
    `signin.redirect_request` inert. Every baseline and restore at `2480 passed, 32 skipped`.
  - Its 9 timeouts: 8 known and confirmed before (`serve` `offer`, `start`, `_send_frame`,
    `_listen`, `_answer` and `_host_ok`; `cli` `_load_trial` and `_load_bounds`).
  - **One was new:** `serve.host_name`. It was rerun locally with no limit and without the
    browser tests, stopping at the first failure:
    `test_the_page_is_served_with_every_pane_and_its_own_nonce`,
    `1 failed, 1180 passed, 32 skipped in 31.19s`. A real catch; XC-140 now names it.
- **CI on `main` after the fast-forward** (push run `37484916099`, on `76fcbff`), read job by
  job: green. Its gate diffed against the previous `main`, `652d5d2`, so it swept the same four
  modules.
  - pytest `2512 passed` on 3.11-3.13, with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC` and `WLX_REQUIRE_BROWSER`.
  - Mutation: 12 shards, 196 functions. **195 caught, 0 survived**; `signin.redirect_request`
    inert. Every baseline and restore at `2480 passed, 32 skipped`.
  - Its 8 timeouts were all known and confirmed: `serve` `offer`, `start`, `_send_frame`,
    `_listen`, `_answer` and `make_handler`; `cli` `_load_trial` and `_load_bounds`.
    `host_name` and `_host_ok` finished inside the limit this time.

## What moved on 2026-10-06: b2b slice 2, signing in with wl.works

**State at 2026-10-06, afternoon (the b2b-ready entry above supersedes it; XC-226 is closed):**
slice 2 is on `main` (branch `b2b-signin`, a
fast-forward once its push run read green). The PI approved its four-item welfare summary
("Approve all four", 2026-10-05; spec §10, "Slice 2 answered"). The PI also ruled that **XC-226
is fixed before any rig switches its https page on**. The welfare-critical list is unchanged.
The https page ships switched off: `wlx serve` serves it only when given the six https flags,
and no rig has a certificate or a name yet. **Next, before any rig uses it:**
1. XC-226: today a bad https setup at a restart takes the rig PC's page down with it.
2. XC-151: a certificate and a name for each rig.
3. XC-152: the rig list sent to wl-works.

XC-223 follows them; it is the one check that needs a live wl.works. wl-works was told on
2026-10-06, with two asks: XC-225's `refreshTokenReuseInterval`, and that `parseRigPages`
refuse a path.

- **What was built** (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin.md`,
  Tasks 5 to 12; spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin-design.md`):
  - **The rig's https page.** `wlx serve --https HOST:PORT --tls-cert --tls-key --rig-page
    NAME=URL --wl-works-issuer URL --wl-works-cache FILE` serves it beside the rig PC's own
    page. The six flags go together or not at all. The rig PC's http page is unchanged.
  - **Signing in.** The page signs a member in with wl.works:
    - authorization code with PKCE S256 and `state`;
    - client `rig-NAME`, with `resource` set to the page's address;
    - scope `offline_access`.

    It renews one at a time before the hour ends, and signs out at the rig. During a wl.works
    outage a signed-in page keeps working and keeps retrying. When its token lapses, the page
    signs itself out, with a sentence that sends people to the rig PC.
  - **The check at the rig.** `wl_xcon/signin.py` checks each access token offline against
    wl.works' keys:
    - RS256 only; `iss`, `aud`, `azp`/`client_id`, and `exp` with 60 s leeway;
    - the keys are fetched with the discovery document at startup and cached;
    - an unknown `kid` refetches the keys at most once a minute;
    - a token signed out here is refused for the rest of its life.
  - **What a member can do.** A signed-in member with `control-rigs` has every control from the
    https page, **the reward and the out-of-cage marks included**. Each act is recorded as a
    `Member` under the member's account. Every ceiling and refusal is unchanged. A command needs
    the page's `Origin` and a valid token, and the body takes no `by`. Over http, a request that
    carries a token is refused before any of the box's checks.
  - **Startup refusals.** `wlx serve` refuses at startup, each in its own sentence:
    - a `--rig-page` with a path;
    - an issuer that is not a bare https address;
    - a discovery document that names another issuer.

    Every refusal caused by the https setup also says how to get the rig PC's page back.
  - **Docs.** ADR-0008 is amended (items 2-4, 2026-10-05). Two asks are in
    `docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`.
  - **Browser tests.** `tests/test_page_browser.py` drives the real page against a fake
    wl.works. It uses Playwright with Chromium, from the `browser` extra, and
    `WLX_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1` makes a missing browser fail rather than skip.
- **Welfare-critical code: none changed.** The parser confirms `link._setting`, `_command_from`
  and `web._hand_reward_now` are identical to slice 1's `main`. `taskd`, `welfare` and `bounds`
  are untouched. `serve.parse_command`, which calls `_setting`, now takes the member from the
  sign-in, not from the body. The PI reviewed the behavior as spec §10 items 1-4.
- **Learned, and worth the next session's time**:
  - **A local sweep can time out on tests that CI's mutation jobs never run.** All 21 of the
    sweep's timeouts came from the browser tests. With those tests excluded, each mutant failed a
    named `test_serve.py` test in 25-92 s. CI's mutation jobs install no browser. They timed
    out on 4 of the 21. They also timed out on `make_handler`, which the sweep caught by name,
    and on `_answer`, which slice 2 did not change. Rerun a sweep's timeouts
    without `test_page_browser.py` to see what CI will see.
  - **A test that allows a connection reset must allow it at any point.** The over-limit test
    caught a reset only as `OSError`. On 3.11, CI's reset landed after the headers and cut off
    the body, which raises `http.client.IncompleteRead`. In 20 local runs, macOS reset before
    the headers 13 times and sent the whole 403 seven times; it never showed CI's case.
  - **This worktree's Python is `.superpowers/venv`.** It is git-ignored and has `pyjwt`,
    `cryptography`, Playwright 1.63 and Chromium. Never `pip install -e` from a worktree, and
    never into the base interpreter: either would repoint the shared install at the worktree.
  - **The browser tests run Chromium only, and the PI uses Safari.** XC-224's copied
    `sessionStorage` is still UNVERIFIED in Safari.
- **Backlog**:
  - XC-015 and XC-186 closed.
  - XC-222 to XC-232 filed. XC-223 is the live check, XC-225 is an ask of wl-works, and XC-226 is
    ruled to come before any rig uses the page.
  - XC-152 now also waits on XC-226.
  - XC-140 widened with the two new CI timeouts and the browser tests' timeouts.
- **Proof, local**:
  - Suite: `2483 passed` three runs in a row at `677d23c` (193-199 s), with
    `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1 WLX_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1`. `2484 passed` at `a19ac5c`.
  - Sweep of every new and changed function: 71 in 5 modules (`signin` 20, `serve` 33, `web` 16,
    `cli.main`, `link.__init__`). 69 caught: 48 by a named failure, and 21 timeouts, each
    confirmed by an unbounded rerun stopping at the first failure.
  - One survivor, `serve.page_address`, now has a test (`4cac91c`). One inert,
    `signin.redirect_request`: its body is already `return None`.
- **Proof, CI on the branch's pushes**, read job by job:
  - **Run `37384787021` on `1932574`: red.**
    - pytest on 3.11: `1 failed, 2483 passed`. The failure was the over-limit test above,
      fixed in `a19ac5c`. 3.12 and 3.13 were cancelled with it.
    - Mutation: 12 shards, 248 functions in 6 modules. **247 caught, 0 survived**;
      `signin.redirect_request` inert. Every baseline and restore at
      `2468 passed, 16 skipped` (the 16 are the browser tests).
    - Its 16 timeouts: 14 known and confirmed before. Slice 1 listed `link` `decode`,
      `deliver`, `publish`, `receive` and `_telemetry_from`; `serve` `offer`, `start` and
      `_send_frame`; `actor` `to_map`, `_text` and `from_map`; and `cli._load_bounds`. The sweep
      above found `serve` `_host_ok` and `_names_this_console`.
    - **Two were new:** `serve.make_handler` and `serve._answer`. Each was rerun locally with no
      limit and without the browser tests, stopping at the first failure:
      - `make_handler`: `test_the_page_is_served_with_every_pane_and_its_own_nonce`,
        `1 failed, 1180 passed in 26.08s`;
      - `_answer`: `test_an_outbox_builds_its_sender_on_its_own_thread_and_answers_each_job`,
        `1 failed, 1352 passed in 49.49s`.

      Both are real catches. XC-140 now names them.
  - **Run `37394112473` on `a19ac5c`: green.**
    - pytest `2484 passed` on 3.11-3.13, with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC` and `WLX_REQUIRE_BROWSER`.
    - Mutation: the gate diffed against `1932574`, so it swept only `serve`, whose test file
      had changed. 75 functions, **75 caught, 0 survived**; every baseline and restore at
      `2468 passed, 16 skipped`.
    - Its 7 timeouts were all known and confirmed: `start`, `_send_frame` and `offer`
      (2026-10-01), `_listen` (XC-140), `_names_this_console` (the sweep above), and
      `_answer` and `make_handler` (above).
- **CI on `main` after the fast-forward** (push run `37396974648`, on `05be792`), read job by job.
  Its gate diffs against the previous `main`, so it re-swept every module the branch changed.
  - pytest `2484 passed` on 3.11-3.13.
  - Mutation: 248 functions, **247 caught, 0 survived**; `signin.redirect_request` inert. Every
    baseline and restore at `2468 passed, 16 skipped`.
  - Its 18 timeouts: 16 known, and **two new**, `link._word` and `cli._load_trial`. The
    branch's first gate had caught `_load_trial` with `373 failed` in 290 s. Each was rerun
    locally with no limit and without the browser tests, stopping at the first failure:
    - `_word`: `test_the_services_commands_cross_a_real_socket_intact[open]`,
      `1 failed, 759 passed in 17.44s`;
    - `_load_trial`: `test_a_clean_task_exits_zero`, `1 failed, 102 passed in 5.02s`.

    Both are real catches. XC-140 now names them.

## What moved on 2026-10-05: b2b slice 1, who did it is an actor

**Resume here (state at 2026-10-05):** slice 1 is on `main` (branch `b2b-remote-signin`, a
fast-forward once its push run read green). The PI approved its seven-item welfare summary
("Approve all seven", 2026-10-05; spec §10 records why that answer, not the day before's, is the
record). The welfare-critical list is unchanged. **Next:** slice 2, signing in (plan Tasks 5 to
13), on a fresh branch `b2b-signin` from this `main`, subagent-driven, with its own PI review of
spec §10 items 1 to 4. Its ledger is
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin/progress.md` in the
`.claude/worktrees/b2b-remote-signin` worktree. It is git-ignored, so slice 2 continues it there.

- **Every `by` is an actor** (`wl_xcon/actor.py`; plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin.md`, Tasks 1 to 4):
  - `Box(name)` is a name typed at the rig PC (the box page, or `--as` at the terminal), shown
    "NAME (box, unverified)".
  - `Member(name, account, issuer, token_id)` is a wl.works member, shown "NAME (wl.works)".
    Nothing makes one until slice 2.
  - Nobody is `None`. The process's own welfare rows record `null` (the ledger's option A, noted
    in the plan at Ruling 4).
  - The wire carries a map (`{"kind": "box", "name": …}`), and a bare string `by` is refused,
    changing nothing. Telemetry schema 14.
  - Every record writer goes through `actor.to_map`, which raises on a string.
  - A record from before b2b reads back with its string names as written (`actor.read`,
    `actor.shown`), and resumes, strands and ends.
  - The page renders every `by` through `web._who`: a member plain, a box name in italics with
    its suffix, so a typed look-alike never passes as a member.
- **Welfare-critical code**: 26 hunks, changing `by`'s type, its written form and one default.
  No rule moved, and `amend_mark` still refuses a blank name in the same words.
- **Learned, and worth the next session's time**:
  - **A question that says "above" needs its list above it, as text.** The first welfare ask
    (2026-10-04) pointed at seven items that never left the controller's working notes, and the
    PI answered without seeing them. They were re-asked with the list written out.
  - **A mutant can break a real client while every test passes.** The final review's hand mutant,
    `wlx console --as` sending a bare string, crashed the real console. A test now pins the `Box`.
  - **`actor.to_map`, `_text` and `from_map` time out in CI**, though each fails by name locally
    in under 2 s when stopped at the first failure. XC-140 names them.
  - **wl-preproc for this worktree's suite**: `wl-preproc` links `.superpowers/wl-preproc-main`,
    an export of wl-preproc's `origin/main` at `ecd1616`. It is git-ignored inside the worktree,
    so unlike the scratchpad it survives a reboot.
- **Backlog**: XC-217 to XC-221 filed (slice 1's open review findings; XC-217 and XC-218 wait on
  slice 2), and XC-140 widened.
- **Proof, local**: `2278 passed` three times in a row with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`. A local
  sweep covered every new and changed function since `1377f4e`, 80 in 14 modules: 74 caught by a
  named failure, and 6 timeouts each confirmed by an unbounded rerun stopping at the first
  failure. None survived.
- **Proof, CI on the branch's push** (run `37273501874`, on `5bf6ffe`), read job by job:
  - pytest `2278 passed` on 3.11-3.13;
  - 12 shards, **388 caught, 0 survived**, `welfare.emit` the known NOT MUTABLE stub, and every
    baseline and restore at `2278 passed`.
  - Its 19 timeouts: 16 were known and verified before (XC-140's `must_stop`,
    `out_of_cage_seconds`, `serve._listen` and `taskd._resume`; the 2026-10-01 full sweep's
    `link` `decode`, `deliver`, `publish`, `receive` and `_telemetry_from`, `serve` `offer`,
    `start` and `_send_frame`, `service.step`, and `taskd` `publish` and `_publish`; and run
    markers' `taskd._ends`). The other three are `actor`'s, new, and confirmed locally above.
- **CI on `main` after the fast-forward** (push run `37285423596`, on `444006f`; its gate diffs
  against the previous `main`, so it re-swept every module the branch changed), read job by job:
  pytest `2278 passed` on 3.11-3.13; **388 caught, 0 survived**, `welfare.emit` the known NOT
  MUTABLE stub, every baseline and restore at `2278 passed`. Its twenty timeouts: nineteen known
  (the branch run's list less `taskd._ends`, which finished this time, `25 failed` in 292 s, plus
  `link._encode_command`, XC-140's), and **`cli._load_bounds`, new**: `216 failed` in 293 s in the
  branch's gate, past 300 s here, so rerun locally with no limit, stopping at the first failure:
  `test_wlx_run_says_which_setup_it_is_holding_the_session_to`, `1 failed, 110 passed in 5.51s`, a
  real catch. XC-140 now names it.

## What moved on 2026-10-02: b2b designed

**State at 2026-10-02, afternoon (the 2026-10-05 entry above supersedes it):** on branch `b2b-remote-signin`, not pushed. The plan is written: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin.md`, approved by the PI ("Subagent-driven"), to be built task by task with a review after each.
wl-works merged and deployed rig sign-in that morning (`4eb2c568`), the trigger this file named
for b2b. The design is written and **approved by the PI** ("Approve, write the plan"):
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-p4d2b-b2b-remote-signin-design.md`. **Next:** its
implementation plan (two slices, spec §13: the `Box`/`Member` actor types first, then signing
in), brought to the PI before any code.

- **Rulings, asked in the UI:** signed-in members get every control, sessions included
  ("Everything"); sign-in at a rig's page goes straight through for a browser already signed in to
  wl.works, with the name always shown ("Straight through"); `wlx serve` checks each token and the
  record carries a typed actor ("1: typed who").
- **Read from wl-works' source and its live documents, 2026-10-02** (spec §3-§5): client
  `wl-works-rig-<name>` from a `RIG_PAGES` entry, `scope=offline_access` alone, `aud` the page's
  origin as one string, a `name` claim, `typ: at+jwt`, RS256 (four 2048-bit keys at
  `https://wl.works/api/auth/jwks`), issuer `https://wl.works/api/auth`. No rig is in `RIG_PAGES`
  yet; that waits on XC-151 and XC-152.
- **Learned, and worth the next session's time:**
  - **PyJWT 2.10.0 checks a string issuer as a substring** (`payload["iss"] not in issuer`, read
    from its wheel): the spec's floor is 2.10.1 and `signin.py` compares `iss` itself too.
  - **`by` is a string in about 470 places** and reaches `welfare`, `bounds`, `marks` and
    `stranded`; `resume.py` reads it back from records, which keep their old string form.
  - **wl.works' token endpoint answers rig origins on every response, refused or not**
    (`rig-cors.ts`'s `withRigCors`), so a refused renewal's `error_description` is readable;
    its revocation endpoint answers no rig origin.
- **Backlog:** XC-102 and XC-147 to XC-149 closed (built by wl-works); XC-015 points at the spec;
  XC-216 filed (the session summary S9a §6 asks for).

## What moved on 2026-10-02: XC-026, a stranded session resumed

**Resume here (state at 2026-10-02):** this change is on `main` (branch `xc026-resume`, a
fast-forward once its push run read green). The PI approved the spec, the plan and an eleven-item
welfare summary ("Approve all eleven"), and left the welfare-critical list as it is ("None of
them", asked whether the resume code should join it). Nothing is in flight. **Next:** XC-207
(block plans from the task program or chosen at the rig), b2b once wl-works says rig sign-in is
deployed, the manual reward's other two slices (XC-157, XC-158; XC-157's line now names the double
count an in-trial hand reward would make on resume), XC-183 and XC-186. XC-211 to XC-215 are this
build's can-wait review findings.

- **XC-026, closed: a stranded `wlx taskd` session can be resumed** (spec
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-xc026-resume-design.md`, §8a its corrections; plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-xc026-resume.md`). The stranded banner offers *resume session*
  beside *end session…* (the PI: "Resume or end"). A resume reopens the same session, appending to
  its record: between runs, or waiting for its return when its runs were ended before its process
  stopped (the PI, 2026-10-01: "Bring it back waiting"). Its departure is restored, never re-taken
  (the PI: "Take it silently"); its fluid so far is restored (`Welfare.restore_fluid`, once, before
  any delivery); its reward size, its out-of-cage limit as the session last had it, and every
  number continue; the in-session clock restarts; 4137 `SESSION_RESUMED` is strobed, provisional.
  It is refused, before anything is written, for the reasons `architecture.md`'s stranded paragraph
  lists; one refused past its limit is then offered only *end*. A record the service cannot read
  fails closed and never stops `wlx taskd` starting.
- **The record keeps what a resume needs**: `trial_starts.jsonl` (each trial's position, written
  before its first strobe, which is where a resume takes every number from), `fluid_ml` and
  `last_reward_at` on each trial line, and `already_delivered_today` in `config.json` (null when
  unknown); a resume also reads the run numbers each run's start row has carried since session
  levels. A record from before this change cannot be resumed: its fluid so far cannot be known, and
  it is never taken as zero.
- **XC-201, closed**: `wlx run` refuses a `--session-id` whose folder exists.
- **Wire**: `ResumeSession` (kind `resume_session`), `Stranded.resumable` and `why`,
  `Telemetry.resumed_at`; schema 13.
- **Accepted by the PI with the summary**: a crash, or a trial that faulted earlier in the
  session, can leave a trial's reward out of the restored fluid (an undercount, so the supplement
  errs larger); an ended-then-crashed session's head-release instant is not restored; and the
  no-repeat promise holds for a process crash, not a power loss (XC-210).
- **Told to wl-preproc**: `docs/pending-wl-preproc-amendments.md`'s new open entry (4137, numbers
  continuing, the head-fixed codes, and its `assemble` bounding a crashed run at the resumed run's
  start).
- **Learned, and worth the next session's time**:
  - **Test the path found what the pieces could not**: the final review's own drives through
    `Service` objects found an ended session resumable, a lowered limit reverted and a run number
    repeatable after a failed run start, all behind green per-task reviews.
  - **A broad `except` in a reader of damaged files is fail-closed only if every caller catches
    what its own next step raises**: three fix rounds each closed one way a bad record stopped the
    service (`resume.read`, then `Session.resume`, then the out-of-cage copy in `_resume`).
  - **`tools/mutate.py` has no time-limit flag**; an unbounded rerun of a CI timeout is done by
    neutering with `mutate._neuter_source` in a `git archive` copy and running pytest there.
  - **wl-preproc for a worktree's suite**: the local `../wl-preproc` checkout is on another branch
    (`spec/run-requests` on 2026-10-02; its `origin/main` is `6a67ae2`), so this build's worktree
    linked `wl-preproc` to a `git archive` export of its `main` in the session scratchpad, which a
    reboot clears. Make a fresh export (`git -C ../wl-preproc fetch` then
    `git -C ../wl-preproc archive origin/main | tar -x -C <dir>`) and link it before running with
    `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1` in a new worktree.
  - **`gh run watch` hit GitHub's API rate limit** on a 1h40m run, and the limit outlasted its own
    reset time; check a long run every twenty minutes instead.
- **Proof**: `2240 passed` three times in a row with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`; a local sweep of all
  36 new and changed functions, every one caught (`link._telemetry_from` by an unbounded rerun).
  CI on the branch's push (run `36932041835`): pytest `2240 passed` on 3.11-3.13; **371 caught, 0
  survived**, every catch a real `N failed` or a timeout. Twelve of the thirteen timeouts were
  verified before (XC-140's and the 2026-10-01 full sweep's list, with `serve._listen`); the new
  one, `taskd._resume` (the pause's resume, which this branch did not change), was re-run locally
  with no limit. The full suite blocked past sixteen minutes (a later end-to-end test waits on a
  paused session that never resumes), so it was run again stopping at the first failure: `1 failed,
  1337 passed in 72.72s`, `tests/test_serve.py::test_e2e_pause_holds_the_trial_count_keeps_the_clock_and_resume_continues`,
  the pause's own resume test, a real catch. XC-140 now names it.
- **CI on `main` after the fast-forward** (push run `36969813494`, on `68703f7`; its gate diffs
  against the previous `main`, so it re-swept every module the branch changed), read job by job:
  pytest `2240 passed` on 3.11-3.13; **371 caught, 0 survived**, every baseline and restore at
  `2240 passed`, `welfare.emit` the known NOT MUTABLE stub. Its sixteen timeouts are all known and
  verified: XC-140's (`must_stop`, `out_of_cage_seconds`), the 2026-10-01 full sweep's (`link`'s
  `decode`, `deliver`, `publish`, `receive`, `_telemetry_from`; `serve`'s `offer`, `start`,
  `_send_frame`; `service.step`; `taskd`'s `publish`, `_publish`; `simulate.signal`), run markers'
  `taskd._ends`, and `taskd._resume` above.

## What moved on 2026-10-01: run markers, and the plan retired

**Resume here (state at 2026-10-01, night):** this change is on `main` (branch `run-markers`, a
fast-forward once its push run read green); the PI approved both parts in the UI ("Yes, both") and
the one welfare-critical docstring it touches (`Service._start`'s, "Approve the wording"). Nothing is
in flight. **Next:** XC-026 (carrying run, block and trial numbers across a crash, the PI: before
January), XC-207 (block plans from the task program or chosen at the rig), b2b once wl-works says
rig sign-in is deployed (it heads wl.works' build order next), the manual reward's other two slices
(XC-157, XC-158), XC-183 and XC-186.

- **XC-205, closed: every run carries wl-preproc's run markers.** Its escape `0x8006` (run in
  session from 1, task code 0) goes out right after the allocation's 4135, computed before anything
  of the run is strobed; its marker 4 goes out on a by-design end, after the open block's
  `BLOCK_END` and before 4136; a fault or interrupt sends neither. 4135/4136 stay (wl-preproc reads
  nothing from them); `runs.jsonl`'s `strobed` still means those two. wl-preproc measures runs from
  the escape and marker into its `core.Run` (its `main` `b0f8b52`). A crashed run is bounded there at
  its last code before the next run, so a hand reward given between runs after a crash counts
  toward it (its choice, ADR-0007). The review found a card fault or Ctrl-C among the run's opening
  emits raised `UnboundLocalError` and published no frame (a window that already existed for 4135):
  `publish` is now bound first, with a test.
- **XC-199 widened again**: for runs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 the run escape's checksum is itself an escape
  value, so a cut trial escape before such a run loses the run and folds it into the faulted one,
  which then reads as closed, and a cut after word 2 can forge `SESSION_END`, `BLOCK_END` or
  `RUN_END` (checked through wl-preproc's `decode_stream` and `assemble`).
- **The plan retired** (the PI, through wl-works, 2026-10-01; wl-works `6a57b1cc`, its montage-plan
  spec §1 and §6): wl.works sends the rig no day's plan; block plans and conditions come from the
  task programs (wl-xtasks) or are chosen at the rig (XC-207); the "unplanned run" label and its
  timing-tier warning are gone from the page, and `unplanned` from `runs.jsonl` (wl-preproc never
  read it). Probes and sites come from SpikeGLX on the rig. XC-150 is narrowed to the task-library
  pull; XC-101 closed (whether a session opens with calibration is decided at the rig); XC-100 keeps
  `prepare-session` (no plan fields) and the fluid envelope, its `planned_task`, `session_intent` and
  `probes[]` withdrawn; dated notes in `docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`; XC-208 lists the
  older specs that still state a day's plan.
- **CI, read shard by shard before the fast-forward** (push run `36886820643`, the branch's first
  push): pytest `2121 passed` on 3.11-3.13; seven modules, **189 caught, 0 survived**, every catch a
  real `N failed`, every baseline and restore at `2121 passed`; the five timeouts (`scheduler.record`,
  `service.step`, `taskd._ends`, `publish`, `_publish`) were each verified before.
- **Proof**: 2121 passed; the review drove nine scenarios through wl-preproc's decoder and assembler
  (each run's escape `(n, 0)` from 1, marker 4 only on by-design ends, every other word unchanged,
  no decode errors); `words_for_run` swept 29 failed, `taskd.run` 264 failed.

## What moved on 2026-10-01: session levels

**State after session levels (2026-10-01, evening; the entry above supersedes it):** built,
reviewed and on `main` (`9880c87`).

- **The PI's rulings, 2026-10-01, asked in the UI.** Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-01-session-levels-and-strip-design.md`,
  plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-01-session-levels.md`, mockup
  `docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-10-01-console-mockup-v13.html` (it declares UTF-8: the PI uses
  Safari, which garbles "·" and "°" in a page that does not).
  - **The vocabulary**: session ⊃ task ⊃ run ⊃ block ⊃ trial. A **run** is one start-to-stop of
    one task; a **block** is one stretch of trials under one block type, inside a run, recurring
    and numbered as it occurs. This superseded wl-works' glossary row of 2026-08-09 ("block = one
    run of one task"), which had made wl-preproc ask for `BLOCK_START` per run that morning.
  - **Ten position numbers on every trial line**, each from 1: trial in session (`trial_number`),
    task, run and block; block in session, task and run; run in session and task; task in session
    (by first appearance). Block numbers in a task continue across its runs.
  - **The strip**: a fluid box (today / floor, then supplement, last reward, back to cage) beside
    Correct / trials at session, task, this run and this block (the block's number in the
    session). The ←cage box is gone, and the supplement is back on the strip.
- **What was built** (subagent-driven, seven tasks, a review each, one fix round in Task 6, a
  whole-branch review that drove real sessions through wl-preproc, one fix wave):
  - `wl_xcon/levels.py` counts every level; `taskd.Session._levels` replaces XC-155's
    `_trial_number`. `runs.jsonl`'s start rows place each run (`run_in_session`, `run_in_task`,
    `task_in_session`).
  - **The recording** marks each block: `BLOCK_START` (`0x8002`, block in session, task code 0
    until wl-xtasks allocates) just before its first trial, `BLOCK_END` (3) when its type is done
    or its run ends by design, then `RUN_END`; none on a fault or interrupt. A block opens with its
    first trial, so a run stopped before any trial uses no number. XC-199 widened: a cut escape can
    now take a block's opening too.
  - **Schema 12**: `Telemetry.performance` (session, task, run and block counts) and
    `returned_at`.
  - **Every run number shown counts from 1**: the page's header, pill, banner, strip, *wl-works
    sees* pane and changes feed, `/health`'s text and the terminal console. Until today the page
    printed the 0-based index; the final review found wl-works reads no rig `/health` run text.
  - The live page has no stalled-animal signal; the mockup's amber is XC-021's.
- **CI, read shard by shard before the fast-forward** (push run `36857750115`, the branch's first
  push, so the gate diffed against `main`): pytest `2107 passed` on 3.11-3.13; twelve modules, 349
  functions in twelve shards of 29-30, **349 caught, 0 survived**, every catch a real `N failed`,
  every baseline and restore at `2107 passed`. Twelve catches were timeouts, eleven of them
  verified before (the b3a-2 and 2026-10-01 entries). The new one, **`serve._listen`, was run
  again locally with no limit: `26 failed` in 313 s**, all in `test_serve.py`, none a hang (XC-140).
- **Proof**: 2107 passed. Task 7's sweep over every new and changed function: all caught but
  `web._per_correct`, which survived and was killed in the fix wave (2 failed); the fix wave's
  re-sweep caught `_state_text` (8 failed) and `_after_service_run` (44 failed). The final review
  drove a `wlx run`, a service session with recurring block plans, faulted runs, a stop mid-block
  and a limit stop through wl-preproc's `decode_stream`, `assemble` and `read_rig_trials`: every
  line's ten numbers matched the stream, every block id matched its lines, every trial lay in its
  block, and every running frame's counts matched the record.
- **Other repositories**:
  - **wl-preproc** accepted the vocabulary and `BLOCK_START` per block, answered XC-198's
    questions (one recording per animal; a trial with no outcome stores; MySQL refuses a
    `trial_id` above 32,767, so those trials are left out and counted), and allocated its own run
    markers: escape `0x8006` (run in session, task code) and marker 4, on its `main` at `b0f8b52`.
    Sending them is XC-205. Its `nwb/conditions.py` now joins lines by `trial_number`.
  - **wl-works** adopted the vocabulary (its spec `2026-10-01-block-run-vocabulary-design.md`,
    `main` `3d0f4358`; `animal_session_block` → `animal_session_run`) and queued XC-150's design
    (the day's plan, which brings real block plans) as its next brainstorm, before rig sign-in's
    build (the PI).
- **The backlog**: XC-198 and XC-203 closed; XC-204 (throttled-container HTTP timeouts), XC-205
  (run markers) and XC-206 (a pause held between blocks is measured inside the earlier one)
  filed; XC-026 due before January.

## What moved on 2026-10-01: the out-of-cage limit is eight hours

- **The PI, 2026-10-01, asked in the UI:** the institution's out-of-cage limit (cage to cage) is
  **eight hours**. The twelve hours recorded since 2026-09-19 as "the institutional figure" was
  simply wrong. No running path used it: `welfare.py` has no default, and no real animal's bounds
  config exists. Corrected on branch `fix-out-of-cage-8h`:
  - `tasks/twelve_hour_bounds.py` is `tasks/eight_hour_bounds.py` (`28_800` s), and its tests'
    constant is `EIGHT_HOURS`;
  - the welfare docstrings, `taskd`'s module docstring and two `wlx run --help` strings say
    eight, as do architecture.md, S8 and the other living specs, each with a dated note;
  - **the typo example changed**. `08:45` for `18:45` (ten hours, though the docstrings called it
    nine) is now refused by the ceiling, so the example of a typo only a person catches is
    `15:45` for `18:45`, three hours early.
  - Every `wl_xcon/` change is text: an AST comparison with docstrings stripped shows only the
    two help strings. The PI reviews the welfare lines before it merges.
- **Dated records keep twelve**, as written then: older CHECKPOINT entries, the plans (two of
  whose manual dry-run commands name `tasks/twelve_hour_bounds.py` and now fail on a missing
  file), `docs/next-session.md` and M0-REVIEW.
- **A trap worth knowing:** after by-hand mutations restored every source byte for byte, `cli`'s
  bytecode stayed mutated (same size, same second, so Python trusted the `.pyc`), and the next
  full run had 3 failures until `wl_xcon/__pycache__` was cleared. Clear `__pycache__` after any
  hand mutation; `tools/mutate.py` already does (`_clear_pycache`).
- wl.works was told: it states no out-of-cage limit, so nothing changes there.

## What moved on 2026-10-01: the port race CI failed on

**Resume here (state at 2026-10-01):** XC-155 is on `main` and green there (below); its reply is
with wl-preproc (XC-198). This entry is a test-only fix, branch `fix-port-race`, asked of the PI
in the UI ("Fix it now"). Nothing else is in flight. Next is the list under b3a-2's entry: b2b
once wl-works has deployed, the manual reward's other two slices, then XC-183 and XC-186.

- **What failed.** CI's baseline (the unmutated suite, before any mutant) failed twice, once on
  XC-155's branch (run `36789375559`, shard 8) and once on `main` after its merge (run
  `36797081773`, shard 3), each time an end-to-end test in `test_serve.py` finding `wlx run`
  ended before the console showed its first trial, with **one warning** where every clean
  baseline on record has none. Each re-run passed. CI's logs carry the warning's count, not its
  text, so what follows is the reproduction's reading, which matches CI's signature.
- **Not XC-155.** It reproduced on neither copy locally under load (36 full runs at twelve
  processes, 144 end-to-end runs at 48), and no session thread was alive across tests. **In a
  Linux container limited to two CPUs it did**: 3 of 80 runs, the warning `ZMQError: Address
  already in use` from `wlx run`'s thread, which had died before making its card. A probe of
  `/proc/net/tcp`, in the two runs it covered, found the port held by a **listening** socket
  with connections into it.
- **The cause: probe, release, bind later.** Eight places in four test files found a free port
  by binding port 0, reading it and releasing it, and `wlx run`, `wlx taskd` or the test bound it
  again later. In that gap the console's own web server, which binds port 0 itself, can be handed
  the same port. macOS never showed it: it hands out port-0 ports in sequence, so it does not
  hand back the one just released. It has been there since the end-to-end tests were written;
  the comment on `CONTROL_TRIAL_BUDGET` now says its "wlx run had ended" of 2026-09-29 may have
  been this too.
- **The fix.** `tests/_ports.py` picks loopback ports from 20000-32767, below the ranges the
  kernels choose from themselves (read 2026-10-01: Linux 32768-60999, macOS 49152-65535;
  GitHub's `ubuntu-24.04` runners pass the test that checks this), checks each is free, claims
  it with an `flock` held until the process exits, so parallel local lanes on one host never
  share one, and **refuses** a kernel whose range reaches into that band rather than trusting it
  (`tests/test_ports.py`, 12 tests; each of its eight guards broken in turn fails one to three
  of them). All eight places use it, and `test_link.py`'s one deliberate release-and-rebind now
  starts from a band port. A failed wait now says how `wlx run` ended, its exit code or the
  exception it raised, and the console's last frame (closes XC-203). **Measured on Linux under the load that reproduced it**
  (six two-CPU containers, `test_serve.py`'s end-to-end tests): **0 of 120 runs** hit the race,
  where the code before it hit 2 of 60; a port held on purpose (a throwaway test, in the
  container only) fails with "wlx run had ended, raising before main() returned".
- **Also seen, filed:** in those throttled containers, the end-to-end tests' 5 s HTTP timeout
  fails too, often, though never yet in CI (XC-204).
- **`main` after XC-155:** its push run's one red shard (3, the race) re-ran green, so XC-155's
  sweep on `main` reads 157 of 157 caught, as on the branch.

## What moved on 2026-09-30, XC-155: every trial framed and numbered in the recording

**State after XC-155 (2026-10-01; the entry above supersedes it):** XC-155 is built, reviewed and **on `main`**
(`d409077..eeec053`, a fast-forward, after a rebase onto the function-shard CI) once its push run
read green shard by shard (below). **Its reply went to wl-preproc on 2026-10-01** (to its session,
`wl-preproc-38`; a copy is in the git-ignored `.superpowers/archive/xc155/ledger-archive/`):
the field is `trial_number`, what the stream carries, what a cut escape and a faulted run cost
there, and three questions (two sessions in one sync-box recording, a trial with no outcome, the
`smallint` ceiling). **XC-198 holds its answer**; reading `trial_number` is wl-preproc's to build.
Nothing is in flight. Next is the list under b3a-2's entry below: b2b once wl-works has deployed,
the manual reward's other two slices, then XC-183 and XC-186.

- **What it does.** Every trial is framed in the event stream: `TRIAL_START` (32), then the
  `TRIAL_NUMBER` escape (0x8001, four words, computed before anything is strobed), the trial's
  own codes, its outcome marker, and `TRIAL_END` (33). A hang still gets `TRIAL_END`; a trial
  that faults or is interrupted gets none. The number counts from 1 across the whole session
  (a service session's runs included) and is each `trials.jsonl` line's `trial_number`, beside
  the per-run `index` and `run`. `CONDITION` is left until conditions exist (the PI, XC-197);
  no block markers, since wl.works asked wl-preproc to take runs (4135/4136) as blocks.
- **Why it mattered.** wl-preproc opens a trial at `TRIAL_START`, names it by the escape and
  closes it at `TRIAL_END`; wl-xcon strobed none of the three, so a real session gave it no
  trials, and its per-run `index` could not be joined. XC-155's own wording ("identifies a trial
  by `TRIAL_NUMBER` alone") had missed the first reason; the research read wl-preproc's
  `assemble` and probed it.
- **Proved for real.** The final review ran a `wlx run` session (45 trials) and a two-run
  `wlx taskd` session (43) through wl-preproc's own `decode_stream` and `assemble`: no decode
  error, every trial numbered with its outcome, every line joined to exactly one trial. A
  session with a fault and a hang came out as designed. `read_rig_trials` still refuses records
  that name a run, until wl-preproc reads `trial_number` (its side; the reply names the field).
- **What a cut escape costs, measured on wl-preproc's decoder**: a card fault, Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or
  crash between the five words cuts the escape, and the decoder takes the next words as its
  payload; when a service session goes on with nothing strobed between, that can swallow the
  next run's `RUN_START` and, cut after the first word, the next trial (XC-199). And a run that
  faults sends no `RUN_END`, which matters once wl-preproc builds blocks from runs (in the reply).
- **Tests and proof:** 2011 passed three times (2037 once rebased onto `d409077`); the path test runs 43 trials through
  wl-preproc so payload words collide with marker values; 23 of 23 targeted mutants caught as
  `N failed` (one survivor, L19, closed by its own test); `run.py` and the welfare-critical
  surface unchanged by diff and AST. Subagent-driven: four tasks, a review each, a whole-branch
  review with the real run, one fix wave, and the controller's one-sentence corrections.
- **CI, read shard by shard before the fast-forward** (push run `36789375559`, the branch's first
  push, so the gate diffed against `main`): pytest `2037 passed` on 3.11-3.13; seven modules
  (`cli`, `codes`, `encode`, `record`, `service`, `simulate`, `taskd`), 157 functions in twelve
  shards of 13-14, **157 caught, 0 survived**, every catch a real `N failed`, every baseline and
  restore at `2037 passed`, the shards taking 29 to 49 minutes. Four catches were timeouts, each
  verified before (`taskd._ends`, `taskd._publish`, `service.step` in b3a-2's entry,
  `simulate.signal`'s known one). **Shard 8 first failed on its `taskd` baseline**, before any
  mutation: `test_serve.py::test_e2e_with_taskd_gone_the_page_is_told_not_delivered` found `wlx
  run` ended before the console showed trial 1, a flake XC-155 cannot cause (its per-trial work is
  six list appends on the simulated card). It did not recur in 24 runs of `test_serve.py`'s 19 end
  to end tests in three loaded lanes locally, and shard 8 re-run passed whole. **Found on
  2026-10-01**: a port race in the tests' setup (the entry above).
- **The backlog:** XC-155 closed; XC-197 (`CONDITION`, waits on XC-150), XC-198 (the questions to
  wl-preproc), XC-199 (the escape on an abort), XC-200 (`run.py`'s hang sentence), XC-201
  (`wlx run` accepts a reused session id); XC-173 waits on nothing now.

## What moved on 2026-09-30, P4d-2b slice b3a-2: sessions from the page

**State after b3a-2 (2026-09-30, evening; the XC-155 entry above supersedes it):** b3a-2 is built, reviewed, **approved by the PI**
(all nine welfare items, 2026-09-30, asked in the UI) and **on `main`** (`263cbfd..c191784`, a
fast-forward) after its push run read green shard by shard (below). **Two builds followed, each
in its own worktree; the second is on `main` since 2026-10-01:**
- **XC-155, trial markers** (the PI chose it next): spec
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-xc155-trial-markers-design.md` and plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-30-xc155-trial-markers.md`, both approved, on branch
  `xc155-trial-markers` in `.claude/worktrees/xc155`, subagent-driven; **its ledger is
  `.claude/worktrees/xc155/.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-30-xc155-trial-markers/progress.md`**. It is
  stacked on `c191784` and rebases onto `main` before it merges; its Task 4 files its backlog items
  at the next free IDs. It tells wl-preproc the join field (`trial_number`) once on `main`.
- **Function-level mutation sharding across 12 CI machines** (the PI, 2026-09-30, to cut the wait
  after each push): **on `main` since 2026-10-01** (`b2020f1..6e48233`, a fast-forward). Whole-module
  sharding left `serve` alone on one machine for 2h42m in b3a-2's run. `mutation_gate.py --shard
  K/N` now splits the selected modules' functions into `N` contiguous chunks whose sizes differ by
  at most one, and hands each module's part to `tools/mutate.py --all --only NAME[,...]`; both
  `mutation` and `mutation-full` run twelve ways. **Measured** on the branch before the merge
  (`workflow_dispatch` run `36772764563`): twelve shards of 1h39m to 2h26m, against 2h26m to 3h33m
  for b3a-2's six-way run of fewer functions (395); the CI row has the rest. A shard's closing
  `mutation gate passed: N module(s)` counts module *parts*, not modules (XC-202).

Next, after those:
1. **b2b (XC-015)** once wl-works says its side is deployed, with XC-151 and XC-152.
2. **The manual reward's other two slices** (P4d-2b spec §6.0): during a trial at the press, per
   frame and measured on the rig first (XC-157); with no session open, a line flush (XC-158).
3. **XC-183**: the three other reference tasks declare their starting values, so the page can
   run them. **XC-186** (a browser-driven test of the page's script) before the page grows more.

- **What it does.** A person at the rig PC's browser does all of a session from the page, as the
  terminal does it, through `wlx serve`'s `POST /commands` (the box's four checks) to `wlx taskd`:
  - *New session* (the animal, head-fixed or chaired, direct or stereoscope, the departure as
    typed, the id, the fluid given today);
  - a far mark's warning answered on the page (a departure: confirm, or amend with a reason; a
    return: confirm, or type it again);
  - the task and its pre-flight, each unknown ticked by its name, and *start run* (the rig takes
    the pre-flight again);
  - *end session* in two steps (the head's release now, the return then or later with
    *record return…*), and a stranded animal's return from its banner;
  - the closed session's summary, supplement owed first, on the End tab until the next open
    (telemetry **schema 11**: `Idle.closed`, held in `wlx taskd`'s memory, XC-188);
  - a refused command's reason shown in the control bar, where the person is.
- **The hand reward outside a run** (the PI, 2026-09-29: "whenever the console is up"): in a
  `wlx taskd` session, from its opening, between runs and while the return is awaited, one press
  is one `reward_correct` through the task's path, strobed and recorded with `where`. During a
  trial it is XC-157's, with no session XC-158's, after a `wlx run` session's run XC-184's.
- **A run starts from its task's own values** (`task.Param.start`): only numbers inside the
  declared range, refused when the task loads otherwise. `fixation_detection` declares the
  mockup's; the other three reference tasks are refused at the page's pre-flight until they do
  (XC-183). The pre-flight fails a number the task uses with no value, and a parameter it never
  declares. `wlx run` takes the starts too, and its `layers` record the task and run apart.
- **Wording, welfare-critical:** a far return's warning now ends "Confirm it, or type it again"
  (a return has no amendment); the departure's is byte-identical.
- **What the PI decided on 2026-09-30:** the nine items; and a pump failure on a hand reward
  outside a run keeps b3a-1's rule (the service stops, the return is recorded as not recorded,
  the stranded rule holds the next start) until the real pump driver defines a failure (XC-187).
  The plan itself: "Approve, build it", "Task by task with reviews".
- **How it was built.** Subagent-driven from the approved plan, eight tasks, each with a fresh
  implementer and reviewer, then a whole-branch review on opus and one fix wave. **The final
  review drove the page in a real browser** (Playwright, against real `wlx taskd` and `wlx serve`
  processes, a `kill -9` and restart among it) and found what every text-reading test had passed:
  the *New session* dialog carried one animal's fluid and times into the next session, the
  closed session's summary was never shown (spec §6.2), and a refused start or return showed
  nothing on the tab the person was on. All three were fixed and the page driven again.
  **Lesson: drive the page before calling a page slice done** (XC-186 makes that a test).
- **Proved able to fail** in `git archive` lanes: 36 function targets and 12 line mutants before
  the fix wave, 16 and 17 in it, every line a real `N failed`, none timed out locally (the slowest,
  `taskd.run`, `taskd._command`, `service._route`, took ~219 s: re-run any CI timeout alone). The
  protected surface is unchanged by AST but for `_manual_reward`, the pass-through's move and one
  sentence in `_command`, and `_far_from_now`'s words.
- **The backlog:** XC-183 and XC-184 filed in the build; XC-185 to XC-195 at merge (the deferred
  findings); XC-016 and XC-176 closed; XC-113 widened; XC-018 and XC-158 wait on nothing now;
  XC-196 after merge (animal folder names must be wl.works' `rigName`, which wl-preproc's
  8-character subject column enforces by quarantine).
- **CI, read shard by shard before the fast-forward** (push run `36737681413`, the branch's first
  push, so the gate diffed against `main`): pytest `1991 passed` on 3.11-3.13; 11 modules, **395
  caught, 0 survived**, every baseline and restore at `1991 passed`, the shards taking 2h26m to
  3h33m. **14 catches were timeouts** on CI's slower runners (`link._telemetry_from`, `decode`,
  `deliver`, `publish`, `receive`; `serve._send_frame`, `offer`, `start`; `service.step`;
  `taskd._ends`, `_publish`, `publish`; `welfare.must_stop`, `out_of_cage_seconds`). **Each was run
  again locally with no limit and each is a real catch**, a test about that function failing in
  13 to 130 s, none a hang: the end-to-end tests notice through their own 10-20 s frame waits,
  which pile up past CI's 300 s. XC-140's class, grown with the suite.
- **What wl.works relies on from wl-xcon** (its message of 2026-09-30, its January canonical-NWB
  spec): `/health`'s `session` reading, which it reads to attach its ELN session to ours; and
  `RUN_START` 4135 / `RUN_END` 4136, which it has asked wl-preproc to count as blocks, since
  wl-xcon emits no `BLOCK_START`/`BLOCK_END` (wl-xcon's run is their block). Renumbering those
  codes, when wl-xtasks owns the final numbering, now reaches two repositories.

## What moved on 2026-09-30, P4d-2b slice b3a-1: the session service

**State after b3a-1 (2026-09-30; b3a-2's entry above supersedes its Next list):** b3a-1 is built, reviewed, **approved by the PI**
(2026-09-30, all ten welfare items, asked in the UI) and **on `main`** (`35dadb6..e51e343`, a
fast-forward), once CI read green shard by shard (below). **b3a-2 is planned and approved**:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-30-p4d2b-b3a2-page-sessions.md` (8 tasks; the PI: "Approve,
build it", "Task by task with reviews"), built subagent-driven on `p4d2b-b3a2-page-sessions` in
the worktree `.claude/worktrees/b3a2`. **Its ledger is
`.claude/worktrees/b3a2/.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-30-p4d2b-b3a2-page-sessions/progress.md`**
(git-ignored): after a lost session, read it and `git log` on the branch, and resume at the first
task without a `complete` line.

Next:
1. **Build b3a-2 (XC-016)** from its approved plan: the page's forms for `wlx taskd`'s commands,
   a run from its task's own values (`Param.start`), the hand reward between runs and while the
   return is awaited, and a far return's warning worded as the rig takes it (the last two
   welfare-critical, to the PI as a numbered summary before merge).
2. **b2b (XC-015)** once wl-works says its side is deployed, with XC-151 and XC-152.
3. **The manual reward's other two slices**, the PI's rulings of 2026-09-29 (P4d-2b spec §6.0):
   during a trial, given the moment it is pressed through a per-frame path like the mark's and
   measured on the rig before it is trusted (XC-157); with no session open, a line flush
   counted to no animal (XC-158). Each is welfare-critical and goes to the PI.

- **What it does.** `wlx taskd --rig --subjects --tasks --root --allocation --link PUB,REP[,MARK]`
  runs all day and holds one animal's session at a time, any number a day, across any number of
  runs. A console opens a session (`OpenSession`: the animal, the setup, the departure), checks a
  run (`CheckRun`: the pre-flight, nothing started), starts it (`StartRun`: the pre-flight taken
  again, each unknown acknowledged by name, or refused) and ends the session (`EndSession`: a run
  in progress stops at its next boundary, the head's release is recorded then, the return now or
  later). Between runs the session sits `between_runs`, head fixed, clocks running. Telemetry is
  **schema 10**: `phase` gains `idle` and `between_runs`, frames carry the run index, the pending
  pre-flight and question, and a separate `link.Idle` frame speaks when no session is open, which
  `wlx console`, the page and `/health` all render.
- **The departure and the return have one home, `marks.py`**, which the terminal and the page
  share; the page's route reads a typed time with the terminal's own parser. A far mark is two
  requests: the first comes back as a question on the frame, and a confirm or amend is taken only
  as the answer to that question, bound to its session, typed time and, for a departure, animal,
  deployment and setup (`service._unasked`). Nothing is written until the departure is accepted.
- **The stranded rule.** At start `wlx taskd` finds every session under `--root` whose
  `welfare_notes.jsonl` has a departure with no return after it, `wlx run`'s `return not recorded`
  sessions and torn records included, and refuses to open any session while one exists. Its
  return is taken with `EndSession` naming it (`Welfare.restore_departure` reads the recorded
  departure back). **What an operator meets:** on its first start, every old `wlx run` session
  under the same `--root` that ended `return not recorded` needs its return first; after a hand
  repair of a record, restart the service (XC-174). `wlx taskd` refuses an allocation without
  `HEAD_FIXED`, `HEAD_RELEASED`, `PARAM_CHANGED`, `RUN_START` (4135) and `RUN_END` (4136).
- **The record.** `config.json` holds what is fixed for the session and is written as it opens;
  `runs.jsonl` has a start row (the pre-flight, who acknowledged each unknown, the seed, the
  values, the bounded config) and an end row per run; trial, control and parameter-change rows
  name their run. **`wlx run` goes through the same `Session.run`**, so its record changed too
  (its welfare behavior did not): wl-preproc now declines to join a `trials.jsonl` whose rows name
  a run, until XC-155 gives it a session-unique key.
- **What the PI approved, and ruled**, 2026-09-30: the ten items of the welfare summary (the
  summary itself is git-ignored, with the build's ledger, in
  `.superpowers/archive/b3a1/ledger-archive/`). Asked which code should need his review, he took
  the two functions the final review had added (`_Routed.drain`, `preflight.unmeasured`) back off
  the list (`8ab9918`). On 2026-09-29 he answered "Where it was left" (a reward size changed in a
  run stays for the session) and ruled that **the console's manual reward works whenever the
  console is up** (spec §6.0; XC-016, XC-157, XC-158).
- **How it was built.** Subagent-driven, ten tasks from the approved plan, a fresh implementer and
  reviewer each (opus for the welfare-critical and concurrency-heavy ones), a whole-branch review
  on opus, one fix wave and a scoped re-review. **What the reviews found that the tasks did not**:
  a stranded record's animal became a path and its `bounds.py` ran before anything checked it (Task
  7, Critical: now `_folder_name`); a confirm could open another animal's session after a warning
  about the first (Task 7: the question binds the animal); a legal task shape, then a malformed
  `Param`, ended `wlx taskd` mid-session from inside the pre-flight (Task 8 and the final review:
  every item now fails closed, `Service._preflight` contains any item's raise); and the PI's
  summary twice claimed more than the code did (`wlx run` "unchanged"; the pump rule's reach), both
  corrected before he read it.
- **Proved able to fail**, by `tools/mutate.py`'s method in ten parallel `git archive` lanes: 131
  new or changed functions in the build (130 caught, `cli._moment` survived and got a test) and 9
  in the fix wave, every line a real `N failed` naming tests about the function, every baseline and
  restore at the suite's count. The protected surface (`bounds.py`, every existing `Welfare`
  method, the five `taskd` functions, `_command`'s two parts, `link._setting`) is identical to
  `main` by AST, docstrings stripped.
- **Learned, worth keeping:** `mutate.py`'s CLI runs a baseline and a restore per function; a
  driver that calls a copy's own `mutate()` after one baseline runs a large target list in lanes
  far faster, and the harness's 300 s limit held for every lane at this suite size.
  **A welfare summary is checked against the code by a reviewer before the PI sees it**: the two
  false statements above were found that way.
- **CI, read shard by shard before the fast-forward.** The first push run (`36678563733`) failed
  three `test_marks` cases on Linux at UTC -- the rig's platform: `9999-12-31T23:59` is a date
  macOS cannot place and Linux can, so there it is refused as in the future rather than as not a
  clock time; nothing is marked either way. `b168195` gave the calendar's last minute its own
  tests, which accept either refusal. That push's gate then swept only `marks` (a push sweeps
  what its own diff changed), so the whole branch was swept by the `workflow_dispatch` full
  sweep, run `36682539013` on `b168195`: pytest `1862 passed` on 3.11-3.13; **29 modules, 544
  caught, 0 survived**, every baseline and restore at `1862 passed`; NOT MUTABLE the two protocol
  stubs. Five catches are timeouts, not a plain `N failed`: `simulate.signal` and
  `scheduler.record` (known, XC-140); **`welfare.must_stop` and `welfare.out_of_cage_seconds`,
  real catches run locally without the limit** (the limit's own tests fail, in 174 s and 186 s:
  b3a-1's end-to-end tests wait out their frames under them, and CI's runners are slower;
  XC-140 now names them); and **`link._binds_beyond_this_machine`, a test that hung**:
  `test_wlx_taskd_refuses_a_folder_that_is_not_one_and_a_remote_bind`, with the refusal gone,
  served until interrupted. It now fails at once if `wlx taskd` serves (the commit after the
  fast-forward), and the whole suite under that mutant ends with it failing. `e51e343` (the
  page's name, below) had its own push run, `36686499286`: `web` and `serve`, 102 caught, every
  line a real `N failed` but `serve.__init__`'s known errors beside its failures.
- **The console is called xcon** (`e51e343`, the PI, 2026-09-30): the page's tab and logo still
  read "expcontroller", which XC-053's `wl_expcontroller` substitution never matched; a test now
  says the old name appears nowhere on the page, and the v12 mockup shows the same.
- **The backlog:** XC-159 to XC-182 filed (the deferred findings, one line each); XC-050 closed
  (Task 10 corrected `taskd.py`'s docstring); XC-016 narrowed to b3a-2; XC-017 now waits on XC-103
  alone; XC-047 reworded to what is still open.

## What moved on 2026-09-29: the package is `wl_xcon`, check 8 fails closed, and direct view part 2

**Resume here (state at 2026-09-29):** three pieces, stacked on one line of history and each
merging by fast-forward, **all built, reviewed and on `main`** (`14658e5`):
1. **The package rename (XC-053)**, `e5779ba`..`6032946`: **on `main`**, fast-forwarded
   2026-09-29 once its CI read green, as the PI approved (asked in the UI, since it touches the
   welfare-critical files: "Merge when green").
2. **Check 8 fails closed (XC-036 to XC-038)**, `5e98066` (`check8-fail-closed`), plus the
   part-2 plan, `88e69ac`.
3. **Direct view part 2 (XC-003)**, `3f8c880`..the tip of `direct-view-part2`, the PI's approved
   plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-29-direct-view-part2.md`.

**The local folder is `~/GitHub/wl-xcon`** since 2026-09-29 (XC-109, done by the PI in a
terminal between sessions): this project's Claude memory moved with it, the package was
reinstalled from it (`wlx check` against the stand-in rig reads `no findings`), and the suite
reads `1557 passed` there. **Everything open is in `docs/backlog.md`** (next free ID XC-154).
**Later on 2026-09-29, b2b was asked of wl-works and b3a designed, planned and started:**
- **b2b (XC-015) waits on wl-works, which said yes.** Its sign-in needs four wl-works changes
  (a client per rig, the rig page as return address, tokens whose audience is the rig, a
  cross-origin token endpoint), asked in `docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md` ("Signing in from
  a rig's page") and **answered yes the same day** by wl-works' session with the PI, with
  conditions (a `control-rigs` permission; one-hour tokens renewing for 24 hours), built after
  its row 45a-2. Asked of us: an https page and certificate per rig (XC-151), the rig list
  (XC-152), and a sign-out on the rig page. A private route to wl.works is probably not needed.
  **wl-works found no trace of our 2026-09-19 client ask**: it never landed there.
- **b3a (XC-016) is designed** (P4d-2b spec §6, approved in conversation section by section),
  after the PI chose to build it while wl-works answers. His rulings: b3 cut into b3a (the rig
  service, several runs per session, open/run/end from the page, pre-flight) and b3b (the
  library pull and the day's plan, XC-150); **the page takes the departure and the return**,
  amending P4d-2a §10; one always-on rig service; any number of sessions a day, one animal
  each (his reminder); a reward size changed in a run stays for the rest of that session.
- **b3a-1, the engine, is being built** from the approved plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-29-p4d2b-b3a1-session-service.md` (10 tasks,
  subagent-driven), on branch `p4d2b-b3a1-session-service` in the worktree
  `.claude/worktrees/b3a1`. **Its ledger is `.claude/worktrees/b3a1/.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-29-p4d2b-b3a1-session-service/progress.md`**
  (git-ignored): after a lost session, read it and `git log` on the branch, and resume at the
  first task without a `complete` line. New welfare-critical code (`marks.py`, `stranded.py`,
  parts of `preflight.py` and `service.py`, `Welfare.restore_departure`) goes to the PI as a
  numbered summary before merge. b3a-2 (the page's forms) is planned after it.

Next:
1. **Finish b3a-1** (above), then plan and build **b3a-2**.
2. **b2b** once wl-works says its side is deployed, with XC-151 and XC-152.

XC-142 (the sibling renames, `wl-exptasks` and `wl-expviz`, still in our code and documents),
XC-140 (`scheduler.record`'s CI timeout), XC-143 and XC-144 (check 8's two remaining gaps) and
XC-145 (a missing settings path is a traceback) are taken when convenient.

### Direct view part 2: every session runs in the setup its operator chose

- **What it does.** `wlx run` takes `--rig` (the rig's settings file, as `--bounds` names the
  bounded config), `--view direct|stereoscope` (required, no default: spec §3) and, in the
  stereoscope, `--subject-settings` (a per-animal file holding the animal's half-IPD: **the PI's
  choice on 2026-09-29**, asked in the UI, over typing it at session start or waiting for
  wl-works). It builds the session's field from them and runs the load-time checks against
  that field **before the link binds, the session opens or the departure is asked about**, so a
  wrong pick is refused with nothing recorded. `taskd.SessionSpec.geometry` is required, so
  `Session.run()`'s own check has the field too: **check 8 and the setup check run outside the
  tests for the first time.** The setup is in `config.json` (`"setup"`: view, half-IPD, viewing
  distance, half-field, mask, housings; `versions.rig`, `versions.subject_settings`), printed by
  `wlx run` as it starts, and published in **telemetry schema 9** (`view`, `half_ipd_cm`), which
  `wlx console` and the page's "display mode" row show. `wlx check` takes `--rig` and checks one
  setup with `--view`, or every setup the task allows without it, the stereoscope at both ends
  of the rig's half-IPD range (1.5-1.9 cm, `Rig.half_ipd_range_cm`) unless an animal is named.
- **What an operator meets today.** `tasks/rig.py`'s direct view still refuses to exist (its
  housings are unmeasured, spec §9 item 1), and every shipped task is written for direct view,
  so **with the shipped files nothing runs**; `--rig tests/_rig.py` (the tests' stand-in, labeled
  as one) is how a dry run is done now, as `tasks/twelve_hour_bounds.py`'s recipe says. That is
  the spec's intent, not a gap. `tasks/reference_subject.py` is the reference animal's settings.
- **How it was built.** Subagent-driven, six tasks, a fresh implementer and reviewer each, then
  a whole-branch review on the most capable model. **The final review found what the in-process
  suite could not**: `tests/_rig.py` imported `tasks.rig`, which the installed `wlx` cannot import
  (`tasks/` is not in the package; pytest gets it only through `pythonpath`), so the only rig
  file that lets a reference task run ended in a traceback outside pytest. It now loads the file
  by path, and a subprocess test runs `wlx check` with `sys.path` as the entry point sees it
  (`python -P`, only this tree's `wl_xcon` importable). **A trap for any test file a `--rig`,
  `--bounds` or task path points at: it must import nothing from `tasks/` or `tests/` by module
  name.** The same wave made every settings-file refusal a sentence (a `ValueError` or
  `TypeError` raised while the file runs), and a direct-view `wlx check` refuse a settings file,
  as `wlx run` does.
- **Proved able to fail**, by the harness in `git archive` copies, scoped to the functions the
  branch added or changed (the whole-module sweep is CI's): geometry `__post_init__` 15 failed,
  `stereoscope` 107; cli `_load_named` 91, `_load_rig` 85, `_load_subject_settings` 8,
  `_setup_words` 6, `_setups` 7, `_session_geometry` 59, `render` 47; taskd `run` 187; record
  `snapshot` 6; link `of` 83, `encode` 34, `_telemetry_from` 29; web `_setup` 9. Every line a
  real `N failed`, every baseline and restore at 1550. Two gaps the harness cannot see, because
  it neuters whole functions, were pinned by tests instead: `Telemetry.of`'s half-IPD read (a
  stereoscope session stand-in) and `wlx check`'s unknown-view path (`or [None]`).
- **No welfare-critical code changed**: `welfare.py` and `bounds.py` byte-identical, and the
  final review compared the listed `cli`, `taskd` and `link` functions by AST.
- **The rulings made during the build** are in the plan's workspace ledger, archived with the
  others (git-ignored, local to this machine) in
  `.superpowers/archive/direct-view-2/ledger-archive/`.
  The ones worth knowing: `wlx run`'s pre-open check (plan decision 7) is why a task refused by
  its checks now leaves no "did not start" row; `wlx check` without an animal checks both ends
  of the half-IPD range; the "try `--view stereoscope`" pointer appears only for a task written
  for either setup.
- **Tests: 1557 passed**, `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`, at the branch tip.
- **On `main` since 2026-09-29 (`6032946..14658e5`, a fast-forward, carrying check 8's commits
  too)**, after the branch's push run `36554427030` read green shard by shard: pytest `1557
  passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13; the gate selected the 11 modules the branch changed or whose
  test files it changed (`calibration`, `check`, `cli`, `gaze`, `geometry`, `link`, `record`,
  `serve`, `task`, `taskd`, `web`) and caught **332, 0 survived**, every line a plain `N failed`
  except `serve.__init__`'s errors beside its real failures, every baseline and restore at
  `1557 passed`. The 2026-09-29 nightly started at 09:57 UTC, before the rename reached `main`,
  so it describes `561254b`.

### Check 8 fails closed

`Stimulus(at=P("pos"))` no longer crashes check 8 (XC-036): a whole position is checked at each
(x, y) point its parameter offers. An `Update` is checked like the `Show` it changes, each
property it leaves alone taking any value a `Show` or another `Update` of that stimulus gives it
(XC-037). A parameter with choices only, no range, half a range or no declaration is refused as
unbounded rather than read as 0 (XC-038); the same holds for an array's radius, an appearance
offered as a choice, and a stereogram's form, which is now evaluated at every combination of its
parameters' bounds (it was evaluated at each upper bound alone). Nine new functions, each caught
by the harness (`_domain` 25 failed, `_numbers` 33, `_is_number` 23, `_points` 25, `_form_reach`
3, `_reachable` 25, `_as_updated` 5, `_offscreen_stimuli` 25, `_described` 2), every restore at
1522. Two gaps left, filed: an array's stereogram items add no depth (XC-143), and no stimulus's
own size is counted, only centres (XC-144).

### The package rename

- **On `main` since 2026-09-29 (`561254b..6032946`, a fast-forward)**, the PI's condition met:
  the branch's push run `36538903518` read green shard by shard. pytest `1508 passed` on 3.11,
  3.12 and 3.13. The first real selection of the six-way push gate (XC-141): the branch's first
  push diffed against `origin/main` and selected all 25 modules, which the shards split 3 to 5
  modules each and ran in **1h43m to 2h24m** (07:49 to 10:13 UTC). **450 caught, 0 survived**,
  every baseline and restore at `1508 passed`. Not a plain `N failed`: `simulate.signal`'s known
  timeout (the 2026-09-20 entry), `serve.__init__`'s `130 failed ... 34 errors` (a real catch
  with errors beside it, as in b2a's sweep), and the two protocol stubs NOT MUTABLE
  (`welfare.emit`, `run.display`). **`scheduler.record` was caught this time, `84 failed` in
  284 s against the 300 s limit**, so XC-140 is still live: it passes or times out by 16 s.
  CI installs the distribution by its new name (`Building editable for wl-xcon`).
- **`serve`'s sweep on `31568ad`** (the pacing commit, the last unsharded push gate): run
  `36530516341`, 60 caught, 0 survived, every line a real `N failed`, every baseline and
  restore at 1508, in 1h48m for the one module.
- **How the rename was proved to be only a rename.** Every file in the package, the tests,
  the tools and the tasks equals its predecessor at `main` with the one name substituted,
  **byte for byte**: `git show HEAD:<old> | sed 's/wl_expcontroller/wl_xcon/g' | cmp -
  <new>` over all 42 package files and every test, tool and task file, run before the commit.
  The only other code edit is the window title in `tools/spike_display.py`. In the
  welfare-critical files that leaves import lines and two path mentions in `link.py`'s
  comments. **No neighbouring repository imports the package**: `git grep` found neither name
  in any of the sixteen `wl-*` checkouts beside this one, so nothing outside this repository
  breaks.
- **A trap for every other checkout and machine: reinstall.** An editable install made before
  the rename still maps `wl_expcontroller` to a directory that is gone, and the `wlx` script
  still imports `wl_expcontroller.cli`, so `wlx` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` until
  `pip uninstall wl-expcontroller && pip install -e '.[dev,contract,console]'`. The
  distribution is now `wl-xcon`. The `wlx` command keeps its name (PI, 2026-09-28).
- **What was renamed, and what kept its old name.** Current documents were renamed: README,
  CLAUDE.md, `wl.yaml` (whose status block still described b2a as unmerged), `architecture.md`,
  the ADRs, the specs, the pending amendments, the roadmap and M0-REVIEW. **Dated documents
  kept their names and gained a naming note** (the PI's rule of 2026-09-28): the five plans
  that name the package, one measurement, two research notes, `next-session.md`, the v12
  mockup, and this file's dated entries (the note is at the top). Also kept on purpose: the
  handover files other repositories hold as `HANDOVER-wl-expcontroller.md`, a PI quote in the
  P4d-2b spec, and ADR-0004's list of the repositories its 2026-09-05 pass touched.
- **The backlog:** XC-053 closed; XC-142 filed; XC-109 now waits on this reaching `main`.
  Six items still said they waited on b2a's merge, which happened on 2026-09-28, and now name
  only what is left.
- **CI at session start, read job by job.** The push gate was sharded six ways by the previous
  session (`5b38c7c`, closing XC-141), and **its first two runs swept nothing**: `5b38c7c`
  changed `ci.yml` and docs, and all six shards of run `36531664506` read `0 module(s) --
  .github/workflows/ci.yml changed; --changed-only does not escalate on it`; `561254b` is
  docs-only, the same. pytest read `1508 passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 in both. So the
  sharded push gate's first real selection is this branch's first push, which diffs against
  `origin/main` and selects all 25 modules (the dry run split them 3 to 6 modules a shard,
  balanced by function count).

## What moved on 2026-09-28, P4d-2b slice b2a: controls from the box

**Resume here (state at 2026-09-28 ~23:15 UTC; superseded by the 2026-09-29 entry above):**
b2a is on `main`. On 2026-09-28 the PI
approved its four welfare items ("Approve all four") and the mark check's measured cost
("Ship, verify on rig": V12 is XC-139). It was fast-forwarded once CI and the full sweep on
the rebased branch read green; "How it merged" below has both. **Everything open is in
`docs/backlog.md`** (next free ID XC-142). **First, read `main`'s CI** on `31568ad` (the
end-to-end sessions paced) and on the commit that shards the push gate (XC-141): every
shard's log, not the run's badge. Then read the 2026-09-29 nightly the same way. Next, in order:
1. **XC-053:** the Python package `wl_expcontroller` → `wl_xcon`, with current code and docs.
   This is the PI's split: names first, code after b2a.
2. **XC-109:** the local folder `~/GitHub/wl-expcontroller` → `~/GitHub/wl-xcon`. Move the
   memory folder with it and run `git worktree repair`.
3. **Direct view part 2:** XC-003, with its carries XC-036 to XC-038.
4. **b2b:** remote sign-in through wl-works (P4d-2b spec §5.7), and its command pipelining
   (XC-121).

PI decisions are asked when they come due, not filed (memory "PI decisions: ask when due").
The brainstorms XC-001 and XC-002 are taken when convenient. wl-works' rename commit,
`2af176ef`, is on its local `main`, and pushing it is the PI's word in that session.

- **What was built** (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-27-p4d2b-b2a-controls.md`):
  M8 closed where commands are decoded; six new commands on the link, each with `by`;
  pause and resume, held at a trial boundary; a manual reward while paused, one
  correct-trial reward per press (the PI's one change at his review of the plan,
  2026-09-28); a mark stamped in the frame it reaches the rig, on a third loopback socket,
  with its note joined by number; a scheduled stop by clock time, trials or fluid, held by
  `taskd`; `controls.jsonl`; telemetry schema 8;
  `wlx console` and the page rendering all of it; `POST /commands` under spec §2's four
  checks, the `Host` check on every request, and `wlx serve`'s command and mark threads;
  the end to end; and `tools/measure_mark_check.py` with its first result and V12.
- **What the task reviews added, beyond the plan:** refusal sentences bounded to
  TEXT_LIMIT; the refusal cap restored for malformed settings; a resume after a stop
  refused; an mL schedule ending at its amount and refusing one already reached; no stale
  schedule on an ended session's frame; wire text stripped of control characters on the
  terminal console; a double click unable to toggle a pause or give two rewards; the
  arrows kept inside the range they show; the write gate's peer check actually tested and
  every malformed body answered in JSON; no manual reward past a due mL stop.
- **Welfare-critical, and waiting on the PI:** while paused the task rewards nothing, a
  person may give one correct-trial reward per press (`reward_correct`, counted in the
  fluid total and toward "stop after X mL"), and the out-of-cage limit still ends the
  session; a scheduled stop, "after X mL" included, can end a session; reward size can be
  set from the page, still capped by its ceiling; and the M8 fix. `taskd.Session._ends`,
  `_hold` and `_manual_reward` joined the welfare-critical list (`architecture.md`), and
  the final review added what items 2, 3 and 4 rest on: `Session.set` whole,
  `Session._schedule` (item 2), the `except (Exceeded, TypeError)` line in
  `Session._command` beside its `held` pass-through, and
  `link._setting`. `welfare.py`, `bounds.py` and the `cli` welfare functions did not
  change.
- **The plan's sixteen decisions** are in its header: the mark socket and its `EVENTS`
  check, verified in pyzmq 27.2.0's source; `--link PUB,REP[,MARK]`; random mark numbers
  below 2**53; the mark's two rows; the pause's housekeeping loop; the schedule's rules
  (exactly now is tomorrow's, with the date said); `controls.jsonl`; `PAUSE`, `RESUME`,
  `OPERATOR_MARK` at 4131–4133; schema 8; `wlx serve`'s threads and answers; the `Host`
  check's names; the page; the welfare list; M8; a test-only speedup; and the manual
  reward during a pause (`MANUAL_REWARD` at 4134; only while held; never re-sent).
- **The display during a pause is structural**: no trial runs, so nothing is drawn. No
  display process exists to show the task's background yet; V12 item 3 proves it on a rig.
- **Carried forward from b2a:** the mark check's frame effect is V12, unmeasured until a
  rig exists; a note typed after the session ended is refused with the post-loop sentence,
  so it is lost from the record (the stamp is kept); the page's script is checked by
  `node --check` and by eye (Task 16 Step 4), never by pytest.
- **Three bounds a test here needs, found by the plan's pre-flight sweep printing `timed
  out`:** a simulated session with a mark socket runs fewer trials a second than one
  without (every frame pays for the check), so a trial budget sized for b1's session held
  each of b2a's end to end tests past 50 s under a broken command path —
  `tests/test_serve.py`'s `CONTROL_TRIAL_BUDGET` is theirs, and `_Session.frame` stops
  waiting once `wlx run` has ended; `Outbox.submit` waits as long as its thread lives,
  so a test calling it on its own thread hangs rather than fails when a job goes
  unanswered — call it through `_submitted`; and a paused loop that stops waiting runs no
  trial and calls no `idle`, so neither the trial budget nor `_Scripted`'s wait budget
  moves — `_Scripted` also counts drains (`PASS_BUDGET`).

**How it merged (Task 16):**
- **The final review (opus)** found the welfare code sound and PI items 1–4 matching the
  code. It found CI red from four end-to-end tests that assumed machine speed.
- **The final fix wave (seven commits)** made those tests wait on states that hold still, and
  guarded the page's and the terminal's clock rendering against unconvertible instants. It
  named in the welfare-critical list what items 2–4 rest on, and fixed the stale
  `--link-allow-remote` wording. Its re-review found all ten findings addressed, with a
  comment-only diff on welfare-critical code. The controller fixed three residuals:
  - a test posted before its recorder had subscribed;
  - `_schedule` was mapped to items 3 and 4 instead of item 2;
  - `_command`'s two welfare-critical parts were not both named.
- **The stop's confirm text is now *stop at a trial boundary, after any commands already
  sent?*** Queued commands reach the rig one boundary apart, so the old text was true only
  with nothing queued (S9a §7). Letting a stop go ahead of the queue is XC-121.
- **The browser check** (a Playwright session against three live `wlx serve`s) passed items
  1–6 and 8–10 with their exact wording. For item 7, the box's own name was checked by
  `curl`, and the second-machine part cannot be checked without a second machine. It found
  XC-113 and XC-114: refusals carry no time, and the name prompt blocks the tab. Its "Ctrl-C
  does not stop `wlx serve`" was an artifact of starting it in the background, where SIGINT
  is ignored. With SIGINT at its default and a live `/events` stream, both b2a and `main`
  exit at once with `serve: interrupted` (a scratch probe, not a committed measurement).
- **Rebased onto `main`.** The conflicts were CHECKPOINT twice and ADR-0004 once, each
  resolved by hand. `git rerere` is now enabled. wl-preproc's rename followed into the one
  path b2a had added (`cbbd4be`).
- **The first CI run on the rebased branch was red.** The staged/applied test failed on every
  attempt. The recorder helper drained every waiting frame before checking any, and
  `_Session.frame` drained too. So on CI, whose runners decode more slowly, a wait returned
  only once the recorder caught up, and by then the trial budget had ended the session. A
  10 ms delay per frame reproduced it locally, 3 of 3. **A trap for any test with a
  recorder: read it one frame at a time, and never inside a live wait.** `ab13277` fixed it;
  with the delay 5 of 5 pass.
- **Then green.**
  - The push run `36481392821`: `1508 passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.
  - The full sweep, `workflow_dispatch` `36481397471`, read shard by shard:
    - 25 modules, **450 caught, 0 survived**, every baseline and restore at `1508 passed`;
    - two `timed out`: `simulate.signal`, the 2026-09-20 entry, and **`scheduler.record`,
      new**. Locally that one is a real catch (`84 failed`), in 165 s against a 63 s
      baseline, so CI's slower runners cross the 300 s limit (XC-140);
    - NOT MUTABLE: `welfare.emit` and `run.display`, both protocol stubs;
    - `serve.__init__` reads `130 failed ... 34 errors`, a real catch with errors beside it.
- **The ledger's open items moved to the backlog** before the plan's workspace was deleted:
  XC-113 to XC-121 and XC-123 to XC-140, each checked against the code. The ledger, the
  reviews and the browser report are archived (git-ignored, local to this machine) in
  `.superpowers/archive/b2a/ledger-archive/`.
- **After the merge, `main`'s own run on `74410f9` (`36497082927`):**
  - pytest was `1508 passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.
  - Its unsharded push gate re-swept the eight modules b2a changed and hit GitHub's
    360-minute job limit. It was cancelled at 200 caught, 0 survived (XC-141).
  - In one of its restore runs, the mark end to end failed on unmutated code: "wlx run
    had ended". The simulated sessions ran unpaced and `wlx serve`'s telemetry thread
    takes every frame, so a slow runner left the console behind until the trial budget
    ran out.
  - The commit that adds this bullet paces those sessions at 5 ms a trial with a budget of 400. The
    probes and the mutation cost are in `CONTROL_TRIAL_BUDGET`'s comment.

## What moved on 2026-09-28: the screen, the stereoscope, direct view, and b2a under way

**State at 2026-09-28 ~15:00 UTC, before b2a finished** (b2a's entry above supersedes this entry's b2a bullets):
- **Everything open is in `docs/backlog.md`** (added 2026-09-28, gathered from this file, the
  specs' open items, `next-session.md`, memory and direct view part 1's ledger). Read it after
  this entry. Direct view part 2 is XC-003 (a missing geometry failing loudly is part of it),
  and the other carries below are XC-036 to XC-038.
- **Direct view part 1 is on `main`** (`370b561`; CI run `36427664739` green, read line by line: the
  gate over `calibration`, `check`, `geometry`, `task` caught 87 of 87, all `N failed`). 1191 tests.
  It adds each setup's field (`Geometry.direct`/`.stereoscope`, `geometry.Rig`, `tasks/rig.py`),
  check 8 per setup, `Trial.view` and three load-time findings (`needs-stereoscope` — live at every
  load today — `wrong-setup`, `unknown-view`), calibration per setup (two records dated
  2026-09-28), and the reference tasks written for direct view at ±16°. **Direct view refuses to
  run on the rig's own settings until the sensor housings are measured at build** (spec §9 item 1;
  `tasks/rig.py`'s NOT YET MEASURED). **Part 2 is next after b2a merges** (`wlx run --view`, the
  geometry into `taskd`'s and `wlx check`'s load-time checks, the session record, a telemetry
  field). Its plan inherits the final review's carries, archived (git-ignored, local to this machine) in
  `.superpowers/archive/direct-view-1/ledger-archive/progress.md` ("CARRY to direct view part 2"): `Stimulus(at=P(...))`
  crashes check 8 (TypeError) and must be fixed before `taskd` gets a geometry; `Update(at/disparity)`
  escapes check 8; choices-only position params read as 0; a missing geometry must fail loudly.
- **b2a** (`p4d2b-b2a-controls`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/p4d2b-b2a`): Tasks 1–12 complete and
  reviewed (origin at `73c4da3`). Task 13 (the manual reward) was cut off by a lost connection with
  its edits uncommitted and intact; its implementer was resumed. Then Tasks 14–16 and the PI's four
  welfare items. **At b2a's merge, rebase onto `main`**: a trial merge of `325fd2b` with direct view
  part 1 was clean and green (1429 passed), but CHECKPOINT will conflict (b2a's Task 15 edits the
  branch's older copy), so merge that file by hand.
- Both ledgers (git-ignored) are `.superpowers/sdd/<plan>/progress.md` inside each worktree.
- **wl-preproc renamed its side on its `main` at ~18:00 UTC** (`0aa4928`):
  `wl_preproc.eye.expcontroller.read_expcontroller_map` is now `wl_preproc.eye.xcon.read_xcon_map`,
  and the session folder is `XCON_DIRNAME = "xcon"`. The old names no longer resolve, and CI checks
  out their `main`, so this broke our import in `tests/test_gaze.py` and `tests/test_calibration.py`.
  **`main` is fixed in the commit that adds this line**, which also closes XC-097: `record.XCON_DIRNAME = "xcon"`,
  and `tests/test_record.py` reads their constant with `ast`. It does not import it, because their
  `contracts/paths.py` imports `wl_sync`, which CI does not check out. That test was proved to fail
  both on a drifted name and against their pre-rename source. **The b2a branch still has the old
  imports and the `"expcontroller"` path literals, so its CI will be red until it is rebased onto
  this.** *(Done at b2a's merge: rebased, the link restored, and the one path b2a had added
  fixed in `cbbd4be`.)* Its worktree's `wl-preproc` link points at a pre-rename snapshot,
  `f7095aa`, in the session scratchpad, so its running agents see a stable tree. After the
  rebase:
  - point the link back at `~/GitHub/wl-preproc`;
  - run `git grep -n 'expcontroller"\|EXPCONTROLLER_DIRNAME\|eye.expcontroller'` for anything b2a added;
  - count what the rebase lands on from the rebased suite, not from the plan.

b2a is being executed subagent-driven on `p4d2b-b2a-controls` (worktree
`.claude/worktrees/p4d2b-b2a`). Its SDD ledger (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-27-p4d2b-b2a-controls/
progress.md` in that worktree, git-ignored) says which task is next and every ruling made; trust
it and `git log` over memory. Tests added by review fixes shift the plan's stated counts; the
ledger keeps the running offset.

- **The PI's answers, 2026-09-28, each asked in plain terms:**
  - **b2a plan approved, plus a manual reward during a pause**: one press gives one
    correct-trial reward (`reward_correct` as applied at the press), counted, recorded with who
    pressed it and strobed as `MANUAL_REWARD` 4134; refused at any other time; never re-sent.
    It is the plan's new Task 13 and part of welfare item 1.
  - **The screen is fixed, at 50 cm from the eyes, in both setups.** The stereoscope is a
    removable device in front of it, so its optical path is `D = Z + HW − E` ≈ 63.15 cm (he
    had reaffirmed 57 cm for the stereoscope earlier the same day, before this constraint).
  - **A midline divider** past the mirror ridge (the ridge alone does not stop the other
    periscope's image), and **an adjustable field stop**: mirrors cut for the full view, a
    removable mask at the panel, starting at ±12°.
  - **The first animal task runs in direct view**, and **the operator picks the setup at
    session start** (a presence switch was offered and declined).
- **On `main`:** the stereoscope redrawn for the PG27UCDM at `Z` = 50 cm (optics drawing, S0
  §5, S3 §8, S4 §7, S5, M0-REVIEW); `Geometry` takes the published active area and
  `Geometry.stereoscope` pins `D = Z + HW − E`; `test_gaze.py`'s import-time `constellation`
  is now lazy, so geometry mutants fail tests instead of collection. **Interim:** the reference
  tasks' target ranges are narrowed to ±12° to fit the stereoscope; direct view's `Geometry`
  restores ±16°.
- **Direct view is specified**: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-28-direct-view-design.md`,
  approved. Part 1 (geometry per setup, `Trial.view`, the checks, calibration per setup) can be
  planned now; part 2 (`wlx run --view`, check 8 wired into `taskd`, a telemetry field) waits
  for b2a's merge, since both change session start. **Check 8 has never run outside the tests**:
  `taskd` and `wlx check` call `check()` without a geometry. Part 2 fixes that.
- **Found and fixed on main:** `--changed-only` swept nothing when a push also touched a shared
  file (`334f6db`).
- **Still to read:** the first sharded nightly (not yet started by GitHub at 08:33 UTC; its schedule has run hours late before); a
  watcher saves its logs to the session scratchpad.
- **Monitor: the ASUS PG27UCDM stays** (PI, 2026-09-28), after comparing the Alienware AW2725Q
  (same active area; DisplayPort 1.4, so DSC at 4K/240; S0 §5.1). **In January 2027, when the PI
  arrives at KU Leuven and can purchase, check Dell's lineup again** for a 27-inch 4K QD-OLED with
  DP 2.1 UHBR20; Dell is easier to order there.
- **Queued for a brainstorm with the PI (his requests, 2026-09-28):** which eye(s) task control
  listens to is XC-001, and automated color calibration and gray-tone linearization is XC-002.
  The options prepared for each are in this entry as of `42e4a9f`, which both items link.
- **Carried:** the per-setup `tools/calibration_design.py` rerun is done (the two 2026-09-28
  records under `docs/measurements/dev-machine/`, direct view part 1's Task 5); the ridge's fade
  at the mask's nasal edge for wide pupils is XC-081.

## What moved on 2026-09-27, afternoon: b1 merged, b2 designed, the camera, CI

**Where b2a stood when this entry was made:** the b2a implementation plan, on branch `p4d2b-b2a-controls` (worktree
`.claude/worktrees/p4d2b-b2a`), at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-27-p4d2b-b2a-controls.md`.
**As of 2026-09-28** it is committed, pre-flighted (every step re-applied in a scratch copy
of 2026-09-27's `main`: 1362 passed after Task 13, 241 functions caught, 0 survived; its
counts now read 3 higher for the gate fix's tests, 1127 checked at `main`), rebased onto
`main`, and waiting for the PI's review of the plan; its pre-flight rulings are in its SDD
ledger (`.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-27-p4d2b-b2a-controls/progress.md` in that worktree,
git-ignored). On his approval, execute it subagent-driven, as b1 was. Not pushed.

- **b1 is on `main`.** The PI chose to merge once CI's pytest legs (`1092 passed` on 3.11,
  3.12 and 3.13, run `36309285075`, logs read) and the local full gate of the same code
  (373 caught, 0 survived, 0 skipped, at `fa221a9`; `7b01992` adds only this file) were
  clean, rather than wait on CI's own full sweep, which was four hours in and heading for
  GitHub's six-hour job limit. That run is the second reading. `main`'s own push run
  (`36323659565`) swept the same code again and was cancelled after its pytest legs passed.
  `1092 passed` on `main` after the fast-forward.
- **b2 is designed** (PI, 2026-09-27, asked in plain terms): the P4d-2b spec §5, on branch
  `p4d2b-b2a-controls`, commit `e426de2`. Split into **b2a**, controls from the box
  (pause with a plain background; stop; settings sent on the arrows' debounce; marks stamped
  into the neural event stream **in the frame they reach the rig**, with a measured
  per-frame check; a scheduled stop held by `taskd`; M8 first), and **b2b**, the same
  controls for people signed in to wl-works, **reward size included**, with the browser
  holding the wl-works token. No earlier limit warning than the 30-minute one. Every
  request is answered only when its `Host` names the console.
- **Rig machines may connect to wl-works** (PI, 2026-09-27) -- for b2b's sign-in. A
  permission, not a route: today the lab LAN has no route to wl-works.
- **The cameras, their own package after b2** (PI, 2026-09-27; its brainstorm has
  started). The separate behavioral-camera system the lab had planned is folded into
  expcontroller:
  - **One headless camera box per rig** (a new S0 role, `rig/cam`), running a daemon
    beside `taskd`, "treated as a part of expcontroller that happens to run on a seperate
    box". Every control and setting lives in expcontroller and the session configuration.
  - **2 to 6 cameras, all dual-purpose**: the high-speed behavioral cameras *are* the
    monitoring cameras, and the console's live view is a thinned preview of chosen ones.
  - **Every camera is a Blackfly S BFS-U3-16S2M-CS**, the eye tracker's own body (maker's
    page read 2026-09-27: IMX273 mono global shutter, no filter, opto-isolated trigger
    input).
  - **For face (eyes, mouth, licking), hands and arms, body and posture, and 3D pose
    from several views**, so every camera exposes on one shared hardware trigger.
  - **200 fps, recording the whole session, compressed visually lossless on the box's
    GPU.** That is about 1.9 GB/s raw across six cameras, so a USB3 controller per camera.
    The GPU's encoding capacity is measured, not assumed.
  - **The eye tracker's IR is 940 nm.** The cameras first try seeing by the tracker's light
    alone, then a 940 nm lamp strobed between the tracker's exposures (which needs one
    clock for both), and 850 nm only if proven invisible and filtered. **Superseded the same
    day** by the PI's two bands; see the parts-list revision below.
  - Viewed only by people who can control.
  - **A shared headless camera framework** (acquisition, triggering, recording, control
    and health through expcontroller). The camera box is its first user.
- **The eye tracker: a feasibility spike on reimplementing OpenIrisDPI** (PI, 2026-09-27)
  as a headless expcontroller service on that framework. The PI chose to go straight to
  the spike rather than first drive OpenIrisDPI through its remote API. The spike answers:
  - P1 and P4 at 500 Hz on two cameras, on Linux: which language for the core;
  - precision against OpenIrisDPI on the same recorded frames;
  - the license approach: OpenIris is AGPL-3.0 and OpenIrisDPI GPL-3.0, while this
    repository is Apache-2.0. A clean-room build from the paper versus a port is the PI's
    call when the spike starts.
- **The display is now the 27-inch ASUS PG27UCDM** (PI, 2026-09-27; S0 §5.1). It is a
  26.5" 4th-gen tandem QD-OLED, 4K/240 over DP 2.1a UHBR20 without compression, with a
  3-year burn-in warranty. It replaces the PG32UCDM Gen 3 chosen the day before.
  - Why: **most experiments view the monitor directly, not through the stereoscope**, which
    needs only ±10° (PI). The tracker camera views the eye from below the screen.
  - The comparison is `docs/research/2026-09-27-panel-27-vs-32.md`. The camera angle differs
    by 1–2° between panels, and DPI's P4 reach (about 10° in macaques) is the limit at 15°,
    not the panel.
  - **Still to do, and it costs a session to rediscover:**
    - ~~direct viewing is designed nowhere~~ **designed 2026-09-28** (see "What moved on
      2026-09-28");
    - ~~§5.2's geometry and the drawing are still 31.5"~~ **redrawn 2026-09-28** for the
      26.5-inch panel, with the mirror sizes and the nasal clip corrected (same entry).
  - Ask ASUS whether pixel cleaning and the Neo Proximity Sensor can be turned off, as
    before.
- **Parts lists for the eye tracker and the camera system: S0 §7** (addendum, 2026-09-27,
  branch `s0-parts-lists`). S0's open items are now §8, with the same item numbers. Every part
  fact is cited to a maker's page read that day, or marked UNVERIFIED. It is a reasoned list
  for the PI, not an order. What would cost a session to rediscover:
  - **NVIDIA's GeForce NVENC cap is 12 sessions per system** (SDK 13.1 application note and
    the support matrix; SDK 13.0 said 8). So 8 cameras fit with 4 spare, and the preview must
    not open NVENC sessions. Throughput for our mono 1440 × 1080 video is unmeasured (§7.5).
  - **The camera box totaled $4,686.93 against a ~$4,000 budget.** The PI chose **two** 4 TB
    drives, accepting about $4,690 (`307816e`). The revision below re-prices the box as AMD.
  - **wl-sync's GPIO26 takes one strobe.** The PI decided (`307816e`) that only the left
    camera's ExposureActive goes to it; the right camera is aligned by its barcode samples.
  - **Lenses:** 12 mm (face) and 6 mm (body), Edmund C VIS-NIR. The BN940 filters and the
    6 mm lens's filter adapter are superseded by the revision below.
- **The parts lists, revised after the PI's row-by-row walkthrough** (2026-09-27, branch
  `s0-parts-lists-v2`; S0 §7, and P9 §1, §2 and §6), **then again for the eye-light drivers,
  the fan-out and the budget** (branch `s0-parts-drivers`; S0 §7.4, §7.6, §7.10). Every
  decision on the 38 rows is applied, and the open picks were researched on makers' and
  distributors' pages the same day. What would cost a session to rediscover:
  - **Edmund Optics first** (PI, 2026-09-27): **every optics, lighting and mounting row has now
    had the Edmund check** (2026-09-28, branch `s0-parts-edmund`, S0 §7.11): the cameras, BN940
    (now #28-792/-793), stages, Teledyne cables, spacers, tripod adapters, LM75 and a diffuser
    moved to Edmund, net +$210–398 a rig (Teledyne's accessories cost more there); BN850,
    LP830, the USB card, the 940 nm light and the monitor arm had no Edmund fit; a
    behind-the-lens 850 nm filter (#73-321) is the PI's call.
  - **Two IR bands.** The behavior cameras use 850 ± 25 nm (MidOpt BN850) with their own
    850 nm lamps, strobed only during exposures. The tracker uses 940 ± 25 nm (Edmund #28-792
    or #28-793). P9's plan of lighting the cameras passively by the tracker's 940 nm is gone.
  - **The tracker lens** is an Edmund C VIS-NIR C-mount: the 75 mm #74-054 for about 45–50 cm,
    or the 100 mm #27-555 for about 57–60 cm. The working distance picks, and the CS-to-C
    spacer is needed.
    - The 0.2× comes from a 200 px pupil and an ASSUMED 3.4 mm pupil.
    - Both lenses (Ø48 and Ø52 mm) are wider than the eyes are apart, so the two cameras toe
      in by about 1°.
  - **One Thorlabs M940L3 with a Ø1" collimator per eye**, on an IPD system: two Edmund
    #16-716 dovetail stages (the DTS25/M is the alternative) and PAHT-CF brackets, the filament chosen from a cited creep comparison. The
    drivers are two LEDD1Bs.
    - **The LEDD1B's current limit stops at 200 mA** (trim pot, a true hardware cap). Its MOD
      input scales 0–5 V onto 0 mA to that limit, so it reaches zero, but only as a software
      cap.
    - **Every finer, lower limit found is firmware** (Thorlabs DC40, DC2200, DC4100/4104;
      Doric; Mightex SLC). Mightex's SLA DIP caps are hardware but coarse (350 mA lowest at
      1 A; the 100 mA version cannot reach the LED's rating). Edmund sells no suitable driver.
    - **Recommended, the PI's call** (S0 §7.10): keep the LEDD1B, trim pot at 1000 mA or less
      and sealed, plus an Edmund NIR reflective ND (flat 700–1100 nm) whose OD is chosen at
      bring-up so the eye stays under the limit at the driver's 1200 mA maximum. $586.06 per
      eye, of which the cap is $162.87. Whether the SM1A38 takes the filter and its ring is
      UNVERIFIED.
    - ICNIRP 2013's cornea-and-lens limit (100 W/m² for 1000 s or more) is cited. IEC 62471
      itself was not read.
  - **The fan-out is a custom board after all** (PI, 2026-09-27), not the PRL-4110. It is
    the first version's design (wl-sync's comparator front end, an SN74AHCT541 channel and a
    47 Ω resistor per secondary), and it **needs a design check**. It drives the
    secondaries' **Line 0**.
    - FLIR's own note wires Line 3, which caps at 3.6 V, so a 5 V board must not use it.
    - The primary feeds the board from **Line 2**, whose unpublished low level is measured.
      Line 1 stays wl-sync's.
    - TI's VOH (≥ 3.8 V at 8 mA) settles the secondaries' 2.6 V high with 47 Ω. **The lamps
      cannot hang off a '541 channel**: the LM75's PNP input needs > 4 V, which TI does not
      guarantee at 3 mA, and its NPN input sinks 14.4 mA. Each lamp needs its own stage.
  - **The camera box is AMD**: a Ryzen 7 9700X on an ASUS ProArt X870E-Creator WiFi, with a
    slot map in which no slot disables another.
    - The priced subtotal is $4,385.96, before the power supply, a rack case and a Noctua
      cooler. That leaves about $304 under the accepted ~$4,690, which likely does not cover
      them. **The PI accepts a modest overrun** (2026-09-27).
    - The power supply is a Seasonic CORE GX ATX 3.1, 850 W. Its price is UNVERIFIED, because
      Micro Center and B&H served bot checks.
    - **No Teledyne guidance on AMD hosts was found.** The AMD host is proven by bring-up
      check 2.
    - On Linux, `pcie_aspm=off` does not disable ASPM.
  - **The lamps** are Smart Vision Lights LM75-850-W (a built-in driver with a PNP strobe
    input), with a MidOpt LP830 on each emitter. **Darkness at the eye position is a
    required bring-up check.**
  - **Waiting on the PI or the layout:**
    - the eye-light cap: the LEDD1B with an Edmund ND, or another driver (S0 §7.10);
    - the fan-out board's design check, including a lamp-strobe stage (S0 §7.4);
    - the tracker's working distance;
    - independent or symmetric carriages;
    - an arm or a stand for the monitor;
    - the rack case and the cooler;
    - cables through a possible passthrough panel (S0 §7.8);
    - and the cameras wait for wl-nas.
- **Pupil and corneal-reflection fallback beyond the DPI's reach** (PI, 2026-09-27; S5).
  Gaze comes from `pupil − CR1`, with its own map and a per-sample method flag, where P4
  cannot be vouched for. Design pending.
- **P10's real-data follow-up** (`f5b95f3`) found that OpenIrisDPI reports P4 through every
  blink, a median 320–340 px off, with `DataQuality` = 100 on every row. That contradicts
  wl-preproc's eye spec §1.1, which says 0/50/100.
- **Outstanding asks to wl-preproc**, not yet sent:
  - the `bcam` sidecar's stale `trigger_source` (P9 §7);
  - the fixed `CR1 − CR4` signal, which the fallback extends;
  - the `DataQuality` description.
- **A flaky test was behind two red runs** (fixed, `403de3c`).
  `test_the_closed_interval_is_printed_once_the_return_is_taken` asserted an exact
  "0 minutes" for an interval opened at `_hhmm()`, the minute truncated. A run crossing a
  minute boundary reads "1 minute", which is right. That failed the b1 branch's CI sweep on
  its *restored* run (run `36309285075`: departure 10:37, return 10:38), the only red in
  it, and is the likely cause of the unexplained 2026-09-25 nightly. Both such assertions
  now accept 0 or 1 minute, and still fail on a wrong interval (checked by shifting the
  departure 60 s and 300 s). CI on the fix: `cli` swept, 23 caught, restored 1124.
- **CI** (PI, 2026-09-27, "both"): split the mutation sweep across parallel jobs, and make a
  push run only the changed modules' check, with the full sweep nightly. **On `main` since
  `c215a10`**: `tools/mutation_gate.py`'s `--changed-only` (never escalates; says what the
  nightly covers) and `--shard K/N` (balanced by `ast`-counted functions), and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `mutation` (push/PR, changed only, diffing against
  `origin/main` when a push has no usable `before`), `mutation-full` (nightly and
  `workflow_dispatch`, six shards) and the `workflow_dispatch` button, with 50 tests in
  `tests/test_mutation_gate.py` (up from 18). **Before merging a big branch, run its full
  check** -- `workflow_dispatch` on the branch, or locally as parallel lanes in separate
  `git archive` copies (the harness mutates files in place). The sharded nightly has not
  run yet; read its six logs the first night.

## What moved on 2026-09-27, P4d-2b slice b1: the read-only browser console

**Merged 2026-09-27** (see the afternoon entry above). b1 was built on branch
`p4d2b-b1-read-only-console`, and the PI approved
it on 2026-09-27, asked in plain terms (`docs/next-session.md` §1): the welfare item
below, "merge after checks"; Ruling 11's yellow `degraded` for a refused frame; and the
session wording "a session is sending on ENDPOINT, but in a format this console cannot
read". In order:

1. The mutation gate and CI on the branch, both clean.
2. The fast-forward to `main`.
3. b2, writes from the box, from the P4d-2b spec §2 and §4.0. Close M8
   (`SetParameter.value`'s type) first.

- **What was built:** telemetry schema 7, `wlx serve`, the page, `/health`, and the files
  it lives in (`serve.py`, `web.py`, `health.py`).
- **The one welfare-critical change:** `Welfare.deliver`'s `wall_now` and
  `last_delivery_wall_at`, and `Rig.wall_clock`, which is `Session.wall_now` — the one
  anchored clock. `deliver` keeps the instant the reward was commanded, once the pump
  returns: `Rig.reward` reads it before `deliver` runs, the charge (`commanded`,
  `deliveries`) still lands before the valve opens, as it always did, and the instant is
  stored only after the pump returns, so a delivery the pump refused is charged but not
  timed. The fonts shipped under ADR-0004's 2026-09-26 amendment. The PI approved the
  welfare item on 2026-09-27: "approve, merge after checks".
- **Ledger Ruling 1 (2026-09-27):** the frame carries its own instant, `wall_at`, and
  `wlx serve` ages a frame on its steady clock, so the time since the last reward never
  reads a host clock against a session instant — the question the pre-flight raised, and
  the controller's answer.
- **The PI's three rulings on the plan** (2026-09-26, recorded in spec §3 and §4.2):
  exactly one featured reading, the most urgent; the strip's correct counts `correct` plus
  `correct_reject`, the one rollup, while every other count stays unrolled; and the fonts
  bundled and served by the box, with ADR-0004 reopened for their OFL-1.1 licenses. Also:
  tick colors are by family, where the mockup's were not.
- **The page's stale banner** runs only while frames are due (running, or awaiting the
  return) — the same answer `/health` uses for *when* frames are due
  (`health.expects_frames`). **The two now agree on the boundary as well**: `/health`
  is stale when `frame_age_s >= --stale-after` on `wlx serve`'s steady clock, and the
  page is stale when `performance.now() − baseline >= --stale-after` on its own
  monotonic clock — `performance.now()`, not `Date.now()`, so a browser clock step
  cannot skew the timer — where the baseline is the event's arrival less its `age`
  (Ruling 12, 2026-09-27). Every event carries `age`, and a keepalive tick re-renders
  from a fresh snapshot instead of sending a comment, so the time since the last
  reward and *wl-works sees* move between frames. Before this, a stalled stream kept
  `ok · Last frame 0 s ago` on the page while `/health` said `degraded`, and a page
  that reconnected onto an old frame showed no stale banner for `--stale-after`
  seconds.
- **A refused frame:** a schema-6 `wlx run` beside a schema-7 `wlx serve` shows a
  *Refused* banner, by design. **Ruling 11 (2026-09-27; approved by the PI the same
  day):** a refusal also makes `/health` and the *wl-works sees* pane `degraded` at once,
  with a *Refused* reading featured after the duration warning and the unreturned-limit
  or fault state and before the last frame's age, until the next frame this console can
  read; a held fault stays `down`. With no frame held, the *Waiting* banner is dropped
  beside a refusal, and the session reading says "a session is sending on ENDPOINT, but
  in a format this console cannot read", the wording the PI chose when asked. Before
  this, a console refusing every frame told wl-works `ok`. With no frame
  and no refusal, the banner and `/health`'s session reading name the PUB endpoint
  nothing has arrived on (`View.endpoint`), rather than asserting that nothing publishes.
- **The telemetry thread's failure ends `wlx serve` (Ruling 9).** A bad `--link`, or any
  exception that escapes the telemetry thread, ends the process. It exits 1, prints a
  sentence and the traceback on stderr, and says the session is unaffected. A console that
  cannot see the session must not look healthy: before this change, a typo in `--link` left
  a page showing no banner and `/health` saying `ok` forever. `parse_link` now also
  requires `tcp://HOST:PORT`.
- **A frame is refused by its schema number first.** `link.decode` reads `schema` before
  any other field and raises `link.SchemaMismatch`, a `link.FrameError`, with the schema
  sentence. `wlx serve` shows that sentence on its page as a *Refused* banner. `wlx console`
  prints it and exits 1, instead of a `KeyError` traceback.
- **The `/health` token file is refused when it is inside any git checkout**, found by
  walking up to a `.git` file or directory; when it holds a non-ASCII character, which
  `hmac.compare_digest` cannot compare, so every request would fail, the correct one
  included; and when it holds a non-printable character, which no header can carry.
- **The full gate's three timeouts were the harness noticing, and each is now `N failed`:**
  `serve.take`, `link.close` and `link.__exit__` (`b85d0d7`). The `link` pair traced to the
  `Session`↔`Rig` cycle. With `close` neutered, the cyclic collector freed `wlx run
  --link`'s `ZmqLink`, and its `weakref.finalize` safety net deadlocked in `term()`, because
  the collector had already dropped the sockets from the context's `WeakSet`. That
  deadlock is fixed (Ruling 18): the finalizer holds the sockets itself (`link._release`).
  That fix's review found `close()` disarming the net when a release was interrupted
  partway, and Ruling 19 had every finding fixed: `close()` now runs `_release` itself
  and detaches the finalizer only after it returns. **Every socket must be appended to
  `_sockets`**: one left out brings the collector deadlock back, and `_release`'s
  docstring says why.
- **The mutation gate treats `tests/_zmq_release.py` and `tests/_frames.py` as global**,
  beside `conftest.py`. A change to either escalates to a full sweep, because both are
  shared test infrastructure whose names match no module.

**Carried forward from b1.** The ledger that recorded these is gitignored, so they are
here, one line each:

- **For b2's design, a question for the PI:** should the `Host` check spec §2 requires for
  writes also apply to reads? DNS rebinding could let a page open in a lab browser read the
  LAN-open `/` and `/events`.
- There is no JSON 500 backstop: a handler that raises gets no JSON error body.
- `HEAD` answers 405 with a body, and no response carries `Allow` or `WWW-Authenticate` —
  wl-preproc parity, which the plan mandated.
- Nothing caps the number of open `/events` connections.
- The startup line prints `http://0.0.0.0:PORT/` for a LAN bind, not an address a browser
  can use.
- `ZmqConsole`'s `receive_timeout_s` is not validated.
- macOS lets overlapping binds succeed where Linux refuses them, so a port clash on the rig
  may not reproduce on a Mac.
- There is no process-level restart test; the manual check covers it.
- `link.decode` checks that fields are present, not their types. **Ruling 9 only makes a
  wrong type loud for `trial_index` and `session_id`**, the two fields `Hub.offer`
  compares -- every other field is unchecked. A decoded frame with `floor_ml="x"` is
  accepted by `Hub.offer`, `/health` still says `ok`, and every page render raises
  `ValueError`, which is what loops a stream on "stream lost".
- Already carried elsewhere, and left there: the Rig↔Session reference cycle (`welfare.Rig`'s
  docstring) and M8 (`SetParameter.value`'s type, closed before b2's writes ship).

**What proved it (Task 13, 2026-09-27):**

- **The test count: 1092 passed** at `fa221a9`, and at every one of the gate's 50
  baselines and restores; `-rs` lists no skip, so `test_health.py`'s and `test_serve.py`'s
  contract tests ran against wl-preproc. Step 1 read 1084 three times in a row at
  `fd8fdce`; the fixes below added the other eight.
- **The mutation gate, read line by line.** The full sweep at `fa221a9`, all 25 modules
  (`pyproject.toml`, `conftest.py` and `tools/mutation_gate.py` changed, so the gate
  selects everything), was run as the gate's own per-module commands in five parallel
  `git archive` copies, so the worktree stayed usable (ledger Ruling 15). **373 caught,
  0 SURVIVED, 0 SKIPPED, 2 inert** (`welfare.emit` and `run.display`, inert on `main` too). Five
  catches are not a real `N failed`, and all five are the ones known on `main` since
  2026-09-20: the four `geometry` imports and `simulate.signal`'s timeout.
  `serve.__init__`'s line totals 1105 because pytest counts 13 teardown errors beside its
  59 failures; the run went to the end. CI's own sweep on the push is the second reading.
- **What the gate found before that, and how each was closed:**
  - The first sweep's 25 baselines all failed on
    `test_wlx_serve_exits_130_on_a_real_sigint`. A run launched as a background job
    inherits SIGINT ignored, an ignored signal survives exec, and the `wlx serve` the test
    spawned never saw its signal. The child now starts with SIGINT at its default, as a
    terminal gives it (`1566820`).
  - Three new timeouts, `serve.take`, `link.close` and `link.__exit__`, were the harness
    noticing, not a test. `take`: a test drained an endless stream with no deadline. The
    `link` pair: this branch's `Rig(wall_clock=Session.wall_now)` puts `wlx run`'s
    `ZmqLink` in a Session↔Rig reference cycle. Freed by the cyclic collector,
    `link.py`'s `weakref.finalize(self, ctx.destroy, 0)` found the context's `WeakSet`
    already empty, closed nothing, and hung in `term()` -- reproduced in a bare script.
    Tests now tear every link down without `close()` (`tests/_zmq_release.py`,
    `b85d0d7`); the finalizer holds its sockets and closes them itself (`link._release`,
    `fd8fa4e`, Ruling 18); and it stays armed through an interrupted `close()`
    (`38c2baf`). Each of the three now reads `N failed`, naming the tests about it. The
    cycle itself was left: it carries the reward instant the PI approved.
- **The page, in a browser** (Chromium through Playwright, a simulated `wlx run` and
  `wlx serve` on loopback). All seven of Task 13 Step 4's checks passed: the page
  advances, its tabs switch with no script, and the right column shows its four
  placeholders; `/health` said `ok` with one featured reading and the page's *wl-works
  sees* pane matched it reading for reading; stopping `wlx serve` showed *stream lost*
  and greyed the page, and restarting it re-rendered the page while the session never
  paused; the ✕ closed the stream and *reconnect* restored it; `wlx console --stop` gave

## What moved on 2026-09-26, afternoon

### The console was designed by mockup, and the PI ruled as it went

- **The design:** twelve rounds of a clickable mockup settled what the browser console is.
  - v12 is `docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-09-26-console-mockup-v12.html`.
  - The review it was checked against is `docs/superpowers/mockups/2026-09-26-console-review.md`, a Fable-model GUI review with sources for every claim about other systems. The PI accepted its top ten and set aside its welfare questions.
- **The rulings:** every ruling made along the way is in the P4d-2b spec,
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-P4d2b-browser-console-design.md` §4.0. Among them:
  - **The ELN owns out-of-cage:** the wl-works ELN records both ends of the interval, and the console takes no return.
  - **Its own clock:** expcontroller keeps a separate in-session clock, shown and recorded, bounding nothing.
  - **Runs:** they follow the day's plan, and an unplanned run is explicit and warned.
  - **The task library:** it is pulled from GitHub (wl-exptasks) before a session's first run.
  - **At the end:** ending a session packages the code it used for wl-nas.
- **The build order:** P4d-2b is built in six slices, b1 → b6.
  - **b1 is specified:** its spec is §4 (`d0375b3`), and its plan is `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-p4d2b-b1-read-only-console.md` (`9cfb94f`). The plan was verified in a scratch copy: 937 tests passed, and every changed function's mutant was caught.
  - **b1 waits on P4d-2a:** it builds only after P4d-2a merges.
  - **b1 is welfare-critical:** its Task 2 (`welfare.deliver` records the last reward's instant) needs the PI's review before merge.
- **ADR-0004 is amended** (PI): unmodified OFL-1.1 fonts may ship as served assets, each
  family's `OFL.txt` beside its files. The code stays Apache-2.0. The licenses of IBM Plex
  and Newsreader were verified at their primary sources.

### P4d-2a was re-cut by the ELN ruling, approved by the PI, and is on `main`

- **The amendment:** spec `2026-09-26-P4d2a-return-to-cage-design.md` §10 moves every welfare duration onto the wall clock.
  - The session reads the host clock once and carries it forward on a steady clock that counts the time the host is asleep (`welfare.SessionClock`, since the final review), so neither a host clock step nor a suspend can shrink out-of-cage time.
  - The return is taken at `wlx run`'s terminal only, as the ELN's stand-in; the link command and `--await-return-for` are gone.
  - The in-session clock is added.
  - §7 is the seven-item list the PI approves.
- **What forced it:** the frame clock outruns the wall in the simulator, so the default `rig-fixed` path could not record its return.
- **Where it stands:** Tasks 1–10 and the final review's fix round are done on branch `p4d2a-return-to-cage`, rebased onto `main` at `f195d6a` and pushed. It was rebased once more, onto `1ef2dc6`, and fast-forwarded onto `main` at `0c18827` after the PI approved it (763 tests).
- **What Task 10 found:**
  - **The rebase:** one conflict, the P4d-2b spec's header, resolved to main's version (ledger Ruling 9). The tree after it differs from the old tip only by main's six documentation files.
  - **The gate** (`tools/mutation_gate.py --base origin/main`, selected `cli`, `gaze`, `link`, `record`, `taskd`, `welfare`): 110 caught, 0 survivors, 0 skips, and `welfare.emit` inert (the documented `Protocol` stub). Every baseline and restore read 739 passed.
    - **One line was not a test noticing.** `taskd._publish` was reported caught by a 300 s timeout. In a scratch copy, `test_a_fault_after_the_loop_is_published_then_raised` called `await_return` on the test's own thread and relied on its first publish raising. With `_publish` neutered it never raised and never returned. The test now bounds `give_up` with a 5 s timer; under the mutation it fails with `DID NOT RAISE`. With that test set aside, the same mutation already failed 19 others in 20 s, so the function was covered and the harness could not say so.
    - **The taskd re-sweep** after that fix (and one docstring change): all 30 names read `N failed`, `_publish` among them at 20 failed, with the baseline and restore at 739.
    - **One gap the harness cannot see, closed.** `Session.duration_warning` has two halves: `approaching_limit`'s sentence while the loop runs, and `must_stop`'s after it. Only the post-loop half was pinned (`1 failed`). `test_link.py` checks `Telemetry.of` against a stand-in whose `duration_warning` is a lambda, so a real session silent until its loop ended failed no test. That is the warning the PI asked for on 2026-09-20. `test_while_the_loop_runs_each_frame_carries_the_sessions_own_warning` pins it: with only the during-loop half silenced, the other 739 pass and it fails. The function now reads `2 failed`.
    - **Each function the plan added or changed** was checked for a test from this plan in its failing set, in a scratch copy wherever the `<-` list was truncated. All have one except `welfare.preflight` and `welfare.approaching_limit`. Those are caught only by older tests, which Task 7 rewrote onto wall instants, so the catch is still on the new base.
  - **CI, read from the job logs** (`gh api …/actions/jobs/<id>/logs`, because `gh run view --log` refuses while any job in the run is still going):
    - **Tip `e9d9f75`, run `36250082636`:** `740 passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC: 1`, and no skips. The gate selected `taskd` alone and read 30 of 30 `N failed`, at 740.
    - **First push `461f2ca`, run `36249806595`:** `739 passed` on all three. A new branch's first push has an all-zero `before`, so the gate ran the **full sweep** ("cannot diff … not guessing", 2h41m). It covered 22 modules: 277 caught, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 2 inert (`run.display` and `welfare.emit`, both inert on `main` too), and all 44 baselines and restores at 739. Six lines were not `N failed`. Five are known since 2026-09-20: the four `geometry` imports and `simulate.signal`'s timeout. The sixth is new.
  - **`scheduler.record` timed out, and the final review's fix round fixed it** (ledger Ruling 10; see the next list). What was found: on `main`'s 09-26 nightly it read `27 failed … in 284.58s`, 15 s under the limit. I reproduced it in a scratch copy with a per-test alarm. 28 tests fail at once (22 s for all of them), so the function is covered, but 33 cannot end once a stuck scheduler never finishes its block:
    - 25 are `wlx run` tests in `test_cli.py`. They now reach the 600 s placeholder ceiling only in real time, which is Task 7's accepted cost: a simulated session reaches its ceiling only in real time.
    - 8 are this plan's `test_taskd.py` tests. Their `_Wall` stands still, so a stuck scheduler never stops at all.
    - `_bounds()`' comment in `tests/test_taskd.py` says the ceiling ends a broken scheduler's session "in a fraction of a wall second". That is now true only for sessions built by `_session`, whose wall follows the frames.
    - **Fixed without touching `conftest.py`**, so the gate does not escalate. The eight taskd tests follow the frames with their wall while the loop runs (`_Wall.follow`), and the cage-side one, which has no ceiling for a wall to reach, gets a trial budget. The `wlx run` tests get an autouse fixture in `tests/test_cli.py` that fails a session once it has run ten times its declared trials plus 1,000; measured, no test there runs more than 227. A fixed 10,000 cost about 6.5 s per stuck test on this machine and would have put the mutated suite near the 300 s limit again. `tools/mutate.py` now reads `record  67 failed, 694 passed … in 102.68s`; its two slowest tests (13 s each) are the pre-existing 1,000-trial gate and the transport test, which end at their own large ceilings.
  - **Four stale texts** named the code before Task 9's fix or the removed console return: `Session.end`'s and `Session._note`'s docstrings, and two comments in `tests/test_cli.py`. All corrected. The frame-clock paragraph under "What moved on 2026-09-06" is now marked as history.
- **The final review and its fix round** (opus; "ready for the PI's welfare review: with fixes", nothing Critical). The ledger's `final-review-fixes.md` has the findings and the controller's rulings; each item below has a test that failed at `920e61e`:
  - **I1, a host that sleeps undercounted the interval.** The anchor was carried forward on `time.monotonic()`, which stops during a suspend (macOS `mach_absolute_time()`, Linux `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`). `welfare.steady_seconds` reads `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` on Linux and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on macOS, both documented to count suspend (sources and dates in its docstring), and falls back to `time.monotonic()` elsewhere, saying so.
  - **I5, the clock moved into `welfare.py`** as `SessionClock`, since it decides the interval. `docs/design/architecture.md` and the Status table now name `cli._wall_clock_time`, `cli._clock_or_now` and `cli._settle_return` as welfare-critical code outside the two modules.
  - **I2:** once the return is recorded, `approaching_limit` and `Session.duration_warning` say nothing, so the closed frame no longer tells anyone to bring back an animal already home.
  - **I4:** Ctrl-C during the loop is an operator's stop (`interrupted at the terminal`), published, and `wlx run` still takes the return, then prints the summary and exits 130.
  - **I3:** a terminal-only operator sees the stop reason and the supplement before the return prompt, the out-of-cage clock and any warning above each attempt, and the closed interval once the return is taken. The prompt asks for the *home* cage (`cli._RETURN_PROMPT`).
  - **Minors:** every exit after the departure mark reaches the return path (M1, M2); Ctrl-C tests fail rather than abort pytest (M3); an empty line at the return prompt is one of the three attempts, by the PI's answer (M4); the departure row names who gave it and how (M5); stale console text corrected (M6); a card fault releasing the head after the loop is published (M7). **M8** (`SetParameter.value`'s type) is deferred to P4d-2b's b2, before writes ship.
  - **Refusals:** checked with the AST against `920e61e`: `welfare.py`'s 29 raise messages and `bounds.py`'s 5 are unchanged; `cli.py` gains one `refused: …` site, M1's split of the existing one.
  - **CI on the round's push `f6850ec` (run `36265291974`), read from the job logs:** `761 passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 with `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC: 1`. The gate selected `cli`, `taskd` and `welfare` (base `920e61e`) and read 76 caught — `cli` 19, `taskd` 30, `welfare` 27 — every one a real `N failed`, with no timeouts; `welfare.emit` inert as before; and **one survivor, `cli._interrupted`** (`761 passed`), so the job failed. The round had mutated only `welfare`'s new functions and `scheduler.record` locally, and `_interrupted` is a `cli` helper it added: the last line of a Ctrl-C'd run, asserted by nothing. `cd3a83b` pins both branches (`3 failed`, naming the three Ctrl-C tests), and its CI (run `36267879930`) is green: `761 passed` on 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13, and the gate, base `f6850ec`, selected `cli` alone and read 20 caught, 0 survivors, 0 skips, no timeouts, `_interrupted` at `3 failed`.
- **Approved by the PI on 2026-09-26**, all seven items of spec §7, each asked with the test that pins it (`docs/next-session.md` §1). Fast-forwarded onto `main` at `0c18827`; `763 passed` on the merged tree. The last rounds before approval, written up in the ledger that has since been removed:
  - the final review's fixes;
  - the residuals: a second Ctrl-C during the post-loop wait, a fault printing its stop reason before the return prompt, and `cli._settle_departure` added to the welfare-critical list;
  - a deterministic test for the second Ctrl-C.
- **Next:** P4d-2b slice b1, from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-p4d2b-b1-read-only-console.md`. Check the plan against the merged code first: it was written before P4d-2a's final rounds.

### CI

The 09-26 nightly (`36230556322`) was clean on tests and the full mutation sweep. The 09-25
flake did not recur, and the harness now names any failure it sees.

## What moved on 2026-09-26

### The 09-25 nightly failed on a test the harness would not name

Run `36115579357`, full sweep, on `2ac9bea` — the same commit, the same resolved
packages and the same `wl-preproc` (`87e7318`) as the green nightly the day before:

```
MUTATION GATE FAILED: bounds, check, cli, encode, gaze, run, taskd
```

**Not survivors.** The *unmutated* suite went `1 failed, 673 passed` on 7 of its 41
baselines and restores, spread across 80 minutes, and seven modules failed wherever
it happened to land. `_run_suite` kept pytest's last line and discarded the rest, so
the log says a test failed and never which.

It also landed on mutant runs, and that is the part that matters. Diffing every
mutant's failure count against 09-24's: **24 read exactly one higher, and none read
lower.** A mutant nothing really covers reads `1 failed` in such a run and is
reported `caught`. So a flake does not only turn a build red; it can turn a survivor
green, which is trap 7's shape arriving from a direction the harness had no defense
against.

What is established, each from a run rather than an argument:

- **It predates 09-25.** 09-22 has one `+1` (`simulate.new_trial`, 10 failed against
  9). 09-21, 09-23 and 09-24 have none.
- **It depends on the machine.** 09-25 ran in centralus and was the fastest nightly
  by far (baseline 16.05 s against 19.4–25.2 s on the other four). The runner image
  is not it: 09-23 ran on the same new image (`20260920.314.1`) and was clean.
- **It fails fast.** The failing baselines took 16.18–16.34 s, inside the passing
  range, so it is not a 5 s `RCVTIMEO` or a 15 s thread join.
- **It does not reproduce under control: 0 failures in 313 runs.** 73 on macOS (64
  of them under 8× concurrency), 40 in a Linux / Python 3.13 container with CI's exact
  package versions, and 200 on GitHub's own runners — ten shards across four CPU
  models and six regions, including centralus on an AMD EPYC 9V45 at 14–15 s a run,
  all through the harness's own argv and cache clearing (throwaway branch
  `probe/flake-2026-09-26`, run `36223269006`; branch deleted).

**So the test is still unnamed.** What changed is that the next occurrence will name
it.

### The harness names what failed

`tools/mutate.py` now runs pytest with `-rfE` and keeps its short-summary lines:

- a red baseline or restore prints **every** `FAILED`/`ERROR` line, message included —
  pytest trims that message to the terminal width *except* under `CI`, which GitHub
  sets (pytest 9.1.1, `_pytest/terminal.py:_get_line_with_reprcrash_message` and
  `_pytest/compat.py:running_on_ci`, read 2026-09-26);
- every `caught`/`SURVIVED` line ends `<- node ids`, three named and the rest counted.
  **A `caught` whose only `<-` is a test unrelated to that function is a survivor.**

Proved against itself, and it found something doing so: all five changed functions are
caught by a real `N failed`, but **`_run_suite` survived the first pass** — the argv and
the parser each had a test and the function joining them had none (CLAUDE.md: test the
path, not the piece). It now takes a `cwd` so a test drives it end to end on a
three-test suite.

### A race found on the way, fixed, and not shown to be the flake

`tests/test_cli.py::test_wlx_run_with_link_lets_a_real_console_attach` says its session
has "roughly 1,500" trials of margin. That was measured under the chair-time ceiling the
2026-09-19 rulings removed; the session now ends at `tasks/reference_bounds.py`'s 600 s
out-of-cage placeholder, and `_hhmm()` starts each run 0–59 s into it. Measured **on this
machine, in this session's scratchpad, not committed under `docs/measurements/`, and not
a claim about this system**: about 300 trials in about 0.3 s of wall time, inside which
the console must attach, send, and see two frames. A probe replicating the test with only
the departure varied:

| Out-of-cage budget left | pass | fails fast | fails on a 5 s timeout |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~600 s (the test as written) | 20 | 0 | 0 |
| ~300 s | 10 | 3 | 7 |
| ~120 s | 3 | 0 | 17 |
| ~60 s | 0 | 3 | 17 |

A real race with a margin five times smaller than its docstring says — and **probably not
09-25's culprit**, since here it mostly fails slow and CI's failures were all fast. The
docstring's 1,500 is exactly what CLAUDE.md means by a dated claim nothing can check.

**Fixed as a defect in its own right, not as the flake.** The test now uses `_far_bounds`
(the out-of-cage limit twelve hours away) and the console ends the session itself with a
`Stop` once it has seen the change applied, so no ceiling decides how long the session
lasts. Red first: with `_hhmm()` shifted nine minutes early by a scratch plugin, the old
test failed 5 of 5 on a receive timeout; the new one passes 5 of 5, in 0.2 s rather than
5. It also now drives a console's `Stop` through a real `wlx run`, and that assertion was
shown to fail (`'' == 'stopped by jake'`) with `taskd` made to ignore `Stop`. **If the
flake the harness eventually names is this test, it was this race; if it is another,
this one was still wrong.**

## What moved on 2026-09-20

### P4d-1 is on `main`

**The PI reviewed the welfare surface on 2026-09-20 and approved it**, which was the one
thing holding both branches back (CLAUDE.md: welfare-critical code requires human review
before merge). `p4d1-console-link` was then **fast-forwarded onto `main`**: `300d7d1` →
`08adfa2`, 55 commits, history still linear. P4b rode in with it — it had been sitting
unmerged since 2026-09-13 behind the same review.

What the PI approved, in the four questions that were actually put to them: a mark more
than thirty minutes from now is a person's to confirm or amend with a reason and a name;
the DST switches happen at night when no experiment runs, so they are not designed
around; `returned_to_cage` is a wall-clock mark like the departure; and **zero reward is a
designed outcome** — a trial may have a reward period and deliver no juice, because an
on-screen token may stand in for one. That last one is a task-vocabulary gap, recorded in
§7 and deliberately not designed here.

**What this does not mean.** The merge is verified by the suite — 674 passing on three
Pythons — and *not yet* by the sweep: the `mutation` job of run `35515487242` was still
running when this was written. It is re-running a sweep that already passed on `31a3283`,
so the expectation is green, but an expectation is not a reading. Check it.

### The sweep is green, and four of its entries are green for a reason that is not a test

The full sweep on `31a3283` passed: 22 modules, ~2h, a 674-test baseline, **0 SURVIVED and
0 SKIPPED**. It escalated from the selective gate to all 22 because `tasks/` changed, which
is `mutation_gate.GLOBAL` working as intended. Reading its output rather than its verdict —
the rule that has now paid for itself twice on this branch — turned up four entries in
`geometry` that say `caught` and mean something weaker:

```
caught    half_width_cm                    1 error in 1.20s
caught    half_height_cm                   1 error in 1.21s
caught    half_field_h_deg                 1 error in 1.21s
caught    half_field_v_deg                 1 error in 1.22s
```

**These four are caught by an import, not by an assertion.** Neutering `half_width_cm`
makes `tests/test_gaze.py:42` — `TARGETS = constellation(GEOMETRY)`, which runs at *module
scope* — raise `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'NoneType' and 'float'` from
inside `calibration.constellation`. pytest prints `Interrupted: 1 error during collection`,
runs **zero tests**, and exits 2. `_run_suite` returns `result.returncode == 0`, so every
non-zero exit is recorded as `caught`.

**This is not the old false clean, and saying so matters.** In the recorded incident the
collection error came from the *harness*: a regex inserted a statement into a parameter list,
the file stopped parsing, and a function that had never been mutated was reported covered.
Here the mutation is applied correctly by the AST path and the `TypeError` is its own
consequence, so CI really would be red. The catch is real. It is *incidental*: nothing in the
suite asserts anything about those four properties, and the whole verdict rests on one line
in an unrelated test module that happens to compute at import. **Move that line into a
fixture — an ordinary, desirable cleanup — and all four flip to SURVIVED with no change to
production code.** That is the sense in which the gate is reporting safety it does not have.

The one `timed out after 300s (mutation hangs)` entry, `simulate.signal`, is a different
thing and stands: the harness documents that call and its reasoning, and a suite that stops
terminating has detected the change.

**What this costs the next session.** The harness cannot currently tell an incidental catch
from an earned one, because exit 1 (tests ran, a test failed) and exit 2 (collection aborted,
nothing ran) both reach it as "non-zero". Splitting those in `_run_suite` is small, and the
honest third state is not `caught` — it is *inconclusive*, and it should fail the gate rather
than pass it, because a run in which no test executed is not evidence. Then `geometry`'s four
properties need tests that assert on them, and `tests/test_gaze.py:42` can move into a
fixture where it belongs.

**And the selective gate would not be the thing that told you.** `mutation_gate.select`
maps `tests/test_gaze.py` to the `gaze` module by name, so the PR that moved that line into
a fixture would sweep `gaze` and never look at `geometry`. The four would turn into
survivors on the *nightly*, detached from the change that caused them.

None of this touches P4d-1. `geometry.py` is not on this branch's diff, and the finding is
pre-existing — the first full sweep in a while is simply the first thing to look at it.

### The PI's round-3 rulings: a person on a far mark, a wall-clock return, and three records made

Six rulings in one pass, on the branch the round-2 work is already on. **Two change
behaviour on the welfare path and four are records** — and the two that change behaviour
both came out of the same trade: the marks became clock times, so a plausible typo now
survives every refusal there is.

1. **A mark more than thirty minutes from now is a person's to confirm, or to amend with a
   reason and a name.** *"if a number is input that is more than 30 min from the current
   time, a warning should appear that the experimenter must click through to confirm. There
   should also be an option to update the time if necessary, but a reason should be given and
   the experimenter name logged."*

   **Thirty minutes is his figure**, in `welfare.CONFIRM_MARK_WITHIN`, not derived from the
   ceiling. It is 1,800 and so is `WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT`: **two constants that happen to agree**,
   kept apart so that tuning a console warning cannot quietly move a welfare guard.

   **The band sits between the refusals and both edges still refuse.** A future mark and a
   departure at or past the ceiling are refused outright and never offered for confirmation —
   a prompt that sometimes means "check this" and sometimes stands between an operator and a
   run is a prompt clicked past. **Worth knowing before reading the tests:**
   `tasks/reference_bounds.py`'s ceiling is a deliberately implausible ten minutes, *shorter
   than the threshold*, so that config has an empty band and never prompts.

   **The non-interactive decision, which is the one to check.** `wlx run` asks when `stdin` is
   a terminal and **refuses when it is not**, naming `--confirm-out-of-cage`. A headless run
   that proceeded would write a confirmation nobody made, which is worse than none. The flag is
   the honest way to say it out loud, and the recorded row says the confirmation came from a
   flag rather than a person — **a wrapper with it baked in is how this ruling would otherwise
   be defeated in silence**, and that is the one thing a record can still show months later.

   **The guard is on the marks, not only in `wlx run`.** `welfare.left_cage` and
   `returned_to_cage` take `confirmed` and refuse a far mark without it. CLAUDE.md's rule, not
   belt and braces: both are console actions, and P4d-2's console calling `Session.left_cage`
   directly would reach around the prompt entirely. A caller can lie to `confirmed`; it cannot
   forget it.

   **The amendment is recorded in `welfare_notes.jsonl`, and the choice of file is the
   argument.** Not `parameter_changes.jsonl` — its `sequence` joins a row to a `PARAM_CHANGE`
   strobe on the recording clock, and these marks deliberately have no code (open item 8), so
   a row there would look alignable and be nothing of the kind. Not `refusals.jsonl` — that is
   for writes that did **not** happen, and it is capped against a flooding console peer.
   `record.welfare_note` writes it **at the moment it happens, before `Session.run` opens the
   record**, because the mark must be settled before `preflight` and because a row written
   then survives every refusal that can follow. Each instant is written twice, as a POSIX
   float and as local clock time with its zone, because a person is who reads it.

2. **The DST gap is closed, not fixed.** *"the dst switches happen in the night, when no
   experiments occur."* The unsafe half is spring-forward: `02:30` resolves to `03:30` and
   reports the animal as out up to an hour **less** than it has been. **The description of
   what would happen is kept** in `cli._wall_clock_time` and S8 §5.2 item 4, because the
   dismissal rests on a fact about when experiments run and not on the arithmetic. If night
   sessions ever start — an overnight protocol, an unattended kiosk — it is live again, and
   whoever reads it then needs to find what it does rather than a note saying it was closed.

3. **Zero reward is confirmed, and the reason is new information.** *"zero reward is fine.
   some trials will have a reward period, but they may not receive a juice reward. they may
   get an on-screen token reward that eventually becomes a real reward."* So a zero-volume
   reward is **a designed trial outcome**, not an edge case being tolerated. **`fluid session:
   0.00 mL` no longer implies something is wrong** — a session at zero may be running exactly
   as intended — and nothing may treat it as a fault signal. `supplement` is still the number
   that matters, because a token is not fluid. Carried into S8 §5.2c, S9a §9, `bounds.py`,
   `link.py`, `cli.render` and `next-session.md`.

4. **The return mark is a wall-clock time too, and it closes a real gap.**
   `Session.now()` is frame-derived and stops when the frames do, so an operator who ended a
   session, unchaired the animal, walked it back and *then* marked the return was recording
   the animal as home **at the instant the loop ended** — the release, the unchairing and the
   walk back fell outside the twelve hours, every time. That caveat was written in
   `returned_to_cage`'s own docstring and in `next-session.md` as a note about the caller; it
   was the defect. Struck through in both.

   **`returned_to_cage(at, wall_now, confirmed=False)` maps against `left_cage`'s wall
   anchor**, `Welfare.left_cage_wall_at` — **not** against a fresh `now`/`wall_now` pair. Those
   two are the same instant only while the loop is running, and a mapping built on them would
   drop exactly the interval this ruling exists to count. Every refusal the return had is
   preserved; two are new and both are the departure's — a return in the future, and an
   unconfirmed far one. The confirmation applies identically because a return typed hours ago
   moves the same interval, in the direction that makes a session look shorter than it was.

5. **The thirty-minute warning threshold stands, as a starting value.**
   `WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT` = 1,800 s is his figure now rather than this repository's proposal.
   **Every word of the "not derived from any measurement" note is kept**, because it is still
   true and is exactly why it is a *starting* value: no block duration has been measured and
   nothing under `docs/measurements/` states one. Closed in `next-session.md` §5.

6. **The NTP server is `ntp.wl.works`** (ADR-0009). Two consequences recorded and they are not
   the same shape: the **ICTS alternative closes** — `ntp.kuleuven.be` exists, was verified
   against ICTS's own service page, and is now *checked and not chosen* rather than pending, so
   its rig-segment reachability stops being a question because nothing will depend on it (the
   verification is kept, struck through, because it is why the alternative was real) — and **the
   route stays open**: lab hosts still need a path on UDP 123, flagged in the ADR, in
   `architecture.md` and in the `wl-works` ask. **Naming a host did not open that route.** And
   the line most likely to be misread once `ntp.wl.works` is in a config file is intact: this
   serves bookkeeping time, never experimental time.

**And a finding, recorded as a finding rather than as work.** `task.py`'s `Reward` means
**fluid** — it names a bounded-config entry and reaches `welfare.Rig.reward` → `Welfare.deliver`
→ the pump — and **nothing in the task vocabulary models a token** that accumulates across
trials and later converts. S1 §2.3 lists `Token(+1 / -1)` and `SetPersistent(...)`; `task.py`
implements neither, and `grep -rn "Token\|SetPersistent\|persistent" wl_expcontroller/` returns
nothing. S8 §5.3 already specifies a conversion bound for a mechanism with no representation to
bound. Three things are missing — **a persistent count, a conversion rule through
`welfare.deliver`, and what the recording sees when a token rather than fluid is paid** (an
event-code question before it is a schema one). It is a **gap in S1/S8's vocabulary, not a
welfare-path defect**; written into S8 §5.3, S8 open item 9, S1 §10 item 3 and
`docs/next-session.md` §7, and **deliberately not designed.**

### The review of those rulings, and the invariant it found lying around

**Verdict: safe to merge, no Critical.** The confirmation could not be defeated — probed
with a pipe, a here-doc, `/dev/null`, `yes c |`, a closed fd 0 and a real pty. Two things
worth carrying forward.

**`sys.stdin` can be `None`, and that is not the same as a non-tty.** With file descriptor
0 closed — a daemon, a service manager, a detached `subprocess` — Python leaves
`sys.stdin` as `None`, so `sys.stdin.isatty()` **raises** rather than answering `False`. It
failed safe (no session, no row) and it was still wrong twice over: a traceback where this
same diff promises a sentence, and `--confirm-out-of-cage` — the documented headless path —
defeated. `cli._at_a_terminal()` is the one place that asks now. **If you write
`isatty()`, ask what a closed fd 0 does to it.**

**The restraint record is a cross-check, not only a record.** A return typed one second
after a departure 25 minutes old, on a session head-fixed at 60 s and released at 1,400 s,
gave `out_of_cage_seconds` of **1.0** beside `chair_seconds` of **1,340** — both marks
present, both orderings individually legal, the whole thing inside the thirty-minute band
so nothing prompted, and an impossible pair accepted in silence, under-reporting the exact
interval ruling 4 exists to count. The invariant is free and physical: **an animal must be
out of its cage to be in the chair**, so the interval contains the restraint and can never
be shorter than it. Guarded at the mark (`returned_to_cage` refuses a return before the
release) *and* at the read (`out_of_cage_seconds` refuses the shorter interval), because
`head_fixed` deliberately has no ordering check against the departure and that route
reaches the same impossible pair without any mark being individually wrong. **If you add a
second clock, ask what pairs of readings it makes impossible.**

**And no config that ships could reach the confirmation band at all.**
`tasks/reference_bounds.py`'s ceiling is ten minutes, shorter than the thirty-minute
threshold, so a far departure is refused by the ceiling before a confirmation is offered —
correct on both sides, and it meant nobody could dry-run the one welfare interaction an
operator is asked to perform. `tasks/twelve_hour_bounds.py` is a second reference config
with the real institutional ceiling, same subject `REFERENCE` and the same implausible
fluid placeholders, and `--confirm-out-of-cage`'s help points at it.

**What the sweep found that nobody asked about.** `taskd.Session.return_needs_confirmation`
**survived**, because it was a passthrough nothing called — written for symmetry with the
departure's, which `wlx run` actually prompts with. That is `bounds.check_delivery`'s failure
exactly: a path that reads as present because it exists. **Deleted rather than given a test**,
since the rule it would have exposed is already enforced *by the mark*; a console that wants the
sentence calls `welfare.return_needs_confirmation` directly. The reason is in
`Session.returned_to_cage`'s docstring so the next reader does not re-add it.

### The PI's round-2 rulings: a clock time, a third deployment kind, a warning, and a closed ask

He reviewed the completed welfare change and made four rulings. **Two of them revise
interfaces this same branch introduced**, which is the shape to expect here — the thing
to carry forward is that he changed an interface a session had already justified in
writing, and was right to.

1. **The out-of-cage mark is a clock time, not an interval.** *"A clock time is what an
   operator reads."* `welfare.left_cage(at, wall_now, now)` takes the departure and the
   wall clock as wall-clock instants and the session clock beside them, and **does the
   mapping itself** — he asked for it there rather than in the caller, and the caller is
   exactly where the last version of this went wrong (`cli.py` passed a literal `0.0`).
   `wlx run --out-of-cage-ago SECONDS` is now `--out-of-cage-at TIME`.

   **What it cost, shown to him and accepted.** The ceiling refusal doubled as a
   wall-clock catch — an *interval* of 1.79e9 seconds is fifty-seven years and absurd on
   its face. An *instant* of 1.79e9 is now, so that is gone; and `08:45` typed for
   `18:45` is nine hours of slack inside a twelve-hour ceiling. What replaces it: a
   refusal for a departure **in the future** (against the wall clock the session reads),
   the **ceiling refusal unchanged**, and — the condition he set — **the computed interval
   printed at session start**: `out of cage: the animal has been out 9 hours 15 minutes,
   having left its cage at 2027-01-14 08:45 (CET, this host's local time)`.

   **Date and timezone are resolved, not implicit** (`cli._wall_clock_time`): a naive
   value is read in **this host's local zone**, one with an offset is honoured, an
   ambiguous local hour takes the first occurrence, and a bare `HH:MM` is **today and
   never rolled back to yesterday** — rolling back would turn `23:59` mistyped in the
   morning into an animal recorded as out for most of a day, which is the exact class of
   error the guards are for. Overnight departures are typed with a date.

2. **Head-fixation is a property of the deployment, not of being on a rig** —
   `RIG_FIXED` / `RIG_CHAIRED` / `CAGE_SIDE`, replacing `OUT_OF_CAGE` / `ANIMAL_AT_HOME`.
   He was shown exactly this shape and chose it.

   **The trap, and it is the one this repository has a scar from: a chaired-but-unfixed
   animal *is* restrained.** So `chair_seconds` answers **`None`, never `0.00`**, for the
   two kinds that take no head-fixation marks. A restrained session reporting zero
   restraint is `shortfall()` answering `0` for a day nobody measured, in a different
   costume. Worked through on every surface: `welfare.head_fixed` **refuses** the two
   kinds that declare no marks (otherwise `None` would be *discarding* a measurement
   somebody took); `taskd.Session.run` releases the head only for `RIG_FIXED`, so no
   stream carries a `HEAD_RELEASED` with no `HEAD_FIXED` before it; `Telemetry.deployment`
   goes on the wire so the console can name *which* absence — `n/a -- cage-side, the
   animal is home and unrestrained` against `n/a -- this deployment takes no
   head-fixation marks, so restraint is UNMEASURED here, not zero` — rather than deriving
   it from the pattern of nulls.

3. **The session warns as the twelve-hour limit approaches.** `welfare.approaching_limit`
   returns the sentence, `Telemetry.duration_warning` carries it, `cli.render` prints it
   beside the stop reason. Silent past the limit, where `must_stop` speaks.

   **`WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT` is 1,800 s and is a proposal, not a settled figure — it is in
   the outstanding-asks table for him.** It is **not derived from any measurement of this
   system**: no block duration has been measured and nothing under `docs/measurements/`
   states one, so nothing anywhere claims it clears a block. It is a twenty-fourth of the
   limit, long enough to finish what is running and walk an animal back, short enough not
   to sit on screen for most of a session. `--warn-within` configures it; zero switches it
   off. **It may carry a named default where twelve hours may not, because it bounds
   nothing** — the session ends at the same instant whatever it is. A threshold wider than
   the ceiling is **not** refused: such a session genuinely is inside it throughout, and a
   refusal would make `tasks/reference_bounds.py`'s ten-minute placeholder fail to
   construct a `Welfare` at all. (That refusal was written, measured against the
   placeholder config, and removed — the note is in `welfare.__post_init__`.)

4. **The out-of-cage marks get no event code. S8 open item 8 is closed** (2026-09-20).
   His reasoning: they are **operator-entered rather than measured**, so a hardware
   timestamp would add precision to a number that never had it, and our own log plus the
   session directory already carry them. The head-fixation argument does not carry over,
   because that clock is about an event with a defined instant and this one is about a
   recollection. The consequence follows rather than being conceded: a restart re-asks a
   person for the departure time — the same clock time they typed the first time. It is
   struck through rather than deleted in S8 §8, S2 §5, S9 §3 and `docs/next-session.md`,
   and **removed from the outstanding-ask lists**: it is no longer a question for
   `wl-preproc`.

**`link.SCHEMA` is 5.** `chair_seconds` became `float | None`, `deployment` and
`duration_warning` were added. A console built against 4 renders a `None` chair clock, and
one that coerced it would tell an operator a restrained animal had been restrained for no
time at all — the same "a field still decodes and no longer means what it did" case as 3
and 4, with a welfare quantity on the other end.

**One thing the rulings found that nobody asked about.** Ruling 2 says the 4128/4129
codes belong to `RIG_FIXED` and nowhere else, and `run()` was made to honour it — but
`welfare.head_released` had no deployment guard, so a console action wired straight to
`taskd.Session.head_released` could still strobe a `HEAD_RELEASED` into a stream that
never carried a `HEAD_FIXED`: a restraint record for restraint nothing marked. Found by
asking what the sentence *"no stream carries a HEAD_RELEASED with no HEAD_FIXED before
it"* actually depended on — `run()`, and nothing else. Guarded at both ends now. **If a
ruling gives a mark a condition, check the mark that closes it.**

### The review of those rulings, and the one thing it says about how to write this file

Seven findings, and **three of the four documentation ones were the same defect: verbatim
duplicates of the same argument in `welfare.py` and in S8, which had drifted apart.** The
§5.2d preamble still said "nine `_finite`/`_magnitude` refusals ... eighteen `raise` sites"
while its own closing sentence had been corrected in the same session; §5.2 item 4 said
head-fixation "stays a preflight requirement for a rig session" eighty lines below its own
table saying `RIG_CHAIRED` is a rig session that refuses it; and the same item credited
"no stream carries a HEAD_RELEASED with no HEAD_FIXED before it" to `run()`, which was
never what made it true.

**The fix is not shorter prose, it is one copy.** `welfare.py` is ~140 lines of logic over
twenty methods and 113 lines of refusal messages an operator reads — length is not the
problem. Three blocks that existed **twice** moved to S8, where `CLAUDE.md`'s read order
already sends a reviewer, each leaving a pointer: the seven-column `Deployment` table, the
sixteen-line `WARN_WITHIN_DEFAULT` justification, and `left_cage`'s historical `seconds_ago`
account. **Every refusal message stays verbatim in the code.** If you find yourself writing
the same argument in both places again, put it in S8 and point at it — a copy is a thing
that can disagree, and this round proves it does.

**And the CRITICAL, which is the same lesson one level down.** The `head_released` guard
added at the end of the previous round checked the *deployment* and not whether there was
anything to release — so a `RIG_FIXED` session never fixed still accepted the release,
strobed a 4129 into a stream with no 4128, and then reported `chair: 0:00` for it, with
`returned_to_cage`'s "fixed and not released" check blind to it because `fixed_at` was
`None`. A guard written to make a sentence true, that did not make it true. Two more
refusals on `head_released` (nothing to release; released before fixed) and a computed-
duration guard on `chair_seconds` — which had been checking `now`, a value that is not the
quantity, while `tests/test_welfare.py` exempted `fixed_at`/`released_at` from the
entry-point enumeration *on the grounds that* `chair_seconds` guarded them. **An exemption
is a claim; check what it rests on.**

**What the refusal index did, and it is why §5.2d exists.** The one new refusal in a
welfare-critical file (`which takes no head-fixation marks`) and the two reworded ones
failed `test_every_refusal_has_a_row_in_the_table_and_every_row_still_greps` before
anything else noticed. It also caught a sentence nobody had checked: §5.2d claimed
"nine of them are the two guards of §5.2c and fourteen are structural", and nine
reproduces neither the row count nor the `raise`-site count. Replaced with two figures the
test checks.

### wl-works will run NTP, and lab hosts will synchronize to it

**ADR-0009** (PI, 2026-09-20): welfare marks are now clock times and the daily fluid
figure spans two deployments that cannot otherwise agree what time it is, so wl-works
runs an NTP server and lab hosts synchronize to it. Two costs, shown to him and
accepted. **It needs a routing exception that does not exist today** —
`docs/design/architecture.md`'s topology paragraph is amended, narrowly: the AST
guardrail (over application source) is untouched, and only the routing claim is
qualified, from unconditional to "for the application layer." **A wl-works outage
stops clocks being corrected, and that is mild** — an NTP client keeps its own clock
and drifts; a multi-day outage neither stops a session nor invalidates a day's fluid
accounting. **This is bookkeeping time, never the timing record** — S3's "our log is
not the timing record" is unaffected, and nobody should read an NTP-disciplined wall
clock as good enough for aligning neural data. A preflight clock-skew check is recorded
as work to build, not built here. Ask drafted at `docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`;
alternatives considered (KU Leuven ICTS's `ntp.kuleuven.be`, and the sync box, each with
the concrete reason it lost) are in the ADR.

---

## What moved on 2026-09-19

### The PI's four decisions, and the one open ask they closed

**Taken after the whole-branch review below, and implemented on `p4d1-console-link`.**
Three of the four touch the reward path, and one of them edits a welfare-critical file, so
the human review this branch already waits on now covers `bounds.py` itself rather than
only the capability beside it (`docs/next-session.md` §1).

1. **A welfare-bounded change defers, like an ordinary parameter.** This **reverses
   documentation written one commit earlier**, which correctly described the old
   immediate-apply behaviour in `taskd.py`, `link.Staged`, `cli.render` and a new S9a
   §8.1 — all of them now describe deferral, and §8.1 is rewritten as the history of why.
   `bounds.Bounds.validate` answers "would this be refused" and moves nothing;
   `Session.set` validates at offer time and stages; `_apply_staged` assigns. The value,
   the `PARAM_CHANGED` strobe and the `parameter_changes.jsonl` row now move in the same
   pass, which is what removes the off-by-one in fluid attribution. The cost the PI
   weighed: an operator who has just lowered a volume watches one more trial go out at the
   old one.
2. **A pump fault publishes one frame before it propagates.** `welfare.py` did not change
   for this one (the welfare-clock rulings later the same day are what moved it)
   and `welfare.Rig` still refuses to swallow a pump that will not answer — but the
   exception used to leave `Session.run` with no telemetry at all, so a console watching a
   rig break, unattended and cage-side, saw the stream simply stop. The loop boundary now
   names the fault in `stopped_because`, publishes once, and re-raises unchanged.
3. **A refused welfare-bounded set reaches the session record**, in a new `refusals.jsonl`
   beside `parameter_changes.jsonl`. Telemetry is lossy by design (S9a §9), so a refusal
   that reached only telemetry left no durable trace of an attempt to set a dose above its
   limit. Ordinary parameter typos stay telemetry-only.
4. **`reward_correct`'s maximum is 10 mL, and stops being a dose cap.** At 10 mL a single
   delivery is not a protocol dose, it is the size of thing that happens only when
   software is broken — so it is a **runaway-fluid fault bound**. That **answers the ask
   this file has carried since 2026-09-06** (S8 open item 6, `next-session.md` §5): *"Is a
   runaway-fluid fault limit wanted? Not a ration — a sanity bound catching a software
   fault delivering litres, reported as a fault."* **Answered 2026-09-19: yes, and it is
   this entry.** The *value* beside it (0.05 mL) stays a placeholder until there are
   animals. `bounds.Ceiling`'s docstring no longer claims every maximum is a protocol
   figure — it names the two kinds and leaves the value out of the library — and
   `tasks/reference_bounds.py` labels each entry: `reward_correct` a fault bound,
   `chair_time` a protocol figure. **`max_trials` turned out to be neither** — the
   concept itself is going; see the next entry.

### And a ruling that removes a concept: there is no session-length maximum

Asked because the fault-bound-versus-protocol-figure taxonomy had no answer for
`max_trials`. The answer was more fundamental than a label. **PI, 2026-09-19:** *"There
is no session length max. … Each task, depending on its config, will have a target
number of trials (likely per condition within the task). But the max trials idea makes
no sense to me. The only limit we have welfare wise is that a session from out of cage
to back into cage cannot be longer than 12 hours."*

Most of the replacement was already built — per-condition targets are `scheduler.owed()`,
`Counts` and `upcoming()`, which the console renders as *still needed by condition*. It
was the session-level cap that made no sense.

**Done, same day, once the PI settled the clock** (four rulings; see the next section).
`max_trials` is gone from `welfare`, from `must_stop`, from `tasks/reference_bounds.py`
and from every document that said two ceilings end a session.

### The welfare clock, and the four rulings that reshaped it

**Welfare-critical, and `welfare.py` moved for the first time on this branch** — it had
been at zero diff until now, so the human review this branch waits on (CLAUDE.md,
`docs/next-session.md` §1) now covers all three of `bounds.py`, `welfare.py` and the
console path.

1. **`max_trials` is gone** (above). `welfare.must_stop` takes `now` alone; the parameter
   that carried a trial count was removed rather than ignored, so nothing can pass a
   number and believe it was weighed. `tests/test_welfare.py` pins that a bounded config
   left over from before the ruling, still carrying a `max_trials` ceiling, changes
   nothing.
2. **The clock measures out-of-cage to back-in-cage, bounded at twelve hours.** Chair
   time started at head-fixation and so missed the transport and chairing that precede
   it — it under-counted exactly the interval the institution bounds. `welfare` gained
   `left_cage` / `returned_to_cage` / `out_of_cage_seconds`, and `out_of_cage` is the one
   ceiling `must_stop` reads. **`head_fixed` / `head_released` and their codes 4128/4129
   remain**: chair time is still recorded and bounds nothing. (It was required by *every*
   rig preflight until 2026-09-20, when it became a property of the deployment — see the
   round-2 rulings below.) S8 §5.2 item 4 carries the whole account.
3. **A kiosk session has no duration bound and must declare it.** `welfare.Deployment` is
   a required field with no default: the rig kinds refuse a session missing its mark or
   its ceiling, `CAGE_SIDE` states that the animal never left home (S13 §4.0). (The
   members were `OUT_OF_CAGE`/`ANIMAL_AT_HOME`, and there were two, until 2026-09-20.) **The
   absence of a mark must never be what disables a limit** — an unmarked rig session and
   a cage-side one are indistinguishable to anything that answers zero, so
   `out_of_cage_seconds` **raises** on an unmarked rig session at every call rather than
   only at preflight, and a cage-side config that also states an `out_of_cage` ceiling is
   refused because the declaration and the config must not disagree.
4. **Twelve hours is documented, not configured.** It is in S8 §5.2 item 4 and in
   `welfare.py`'s docstring, and **no constant carries it** — a number with a name is a
   number something defaults to. `tasks/reference_bounds.py`'s `out_of_cage` value is ten
   minutes and stays implausible, per that file's own two guards and the PI's standing
   rule that its placeholders stay placeholders until there are animals.

**Two consequences outside `welfare.py`.** `SCHEMA` was **4** here and is **5** since the
round-2 rulings: `chair_seconds` stopped
being the number that ends the session and `Telemetry.out_of_cage_seconds` is what the
ceiling is read against, so a console built against 3 would show chair time as *the*
clock and then watch a session stop on a limit it never displayed. And the loop bound in
`tests/test_taskd.py` is now the `out_of_cage` ceiling (800 s, a little over four hundred
trials of that task) where it used to be `max_trials=400` — the same size of backstop,
expressed in the unit a real session ends on, so a scheduler mutation still bounds out in
a fraction of a wall second rather than timing out at 300.

~~**Open, and asked of the PI rather than filed:** the out-of-cage marks have **no event
code**.~~ **Answered 2026-09-20: they get none** — see "The PI's round-2 rulings" below.

### And the fix round that followed, which found the mirror of the rule above

Two defects, both of which switched the limit off **while the session reported itself
correctly marked** — so neither is visible in any artifact the session produces, which is
the family this whole module exists to close.

1. **The *presence* of both marks, mis-ordered, was as bad as a missing one.** The rule
   written above is "the absence of a mark must never disable a welfare limit"; it is only
   half. `returned_to_cage` was two unguarded lines beside a `left_cage` that had a careful
   guard. A return *before* the departure gave a **negative** duration, which is under
   every ceiling there is — a session with a 2-second limit ran 300 trials with the clock
   reading −429 s. A return marked **mid-session froze** the clock, so `must_stop` answered
   `None` for the rest of it. And `left_cage`'s guard was `left_cage_at is not None and
   returned_at is None`, so a return **re-armed** it: out at 0, home at 43,000, out again
   at 43,100 reported a fresh clock for an animal out twenty-two hours.

   The interval is now **opened once, closed once, and never runs backwards**. A return is
   refused unless it closes an open interval, refused while the animal is recorded
   head-fixed — it cannot be in the chair and in its cage at once, and `run()` fixes before
   its first frame and releases after its last, so the whole loop sits inside that refusal —
   and refused before the departure. A closed interval refuses a `preflight` and **stops** a
   running session rather than freezing it.

   **Out and back is one session — PI, asked and answered 2026-09-20.** The code was
   written that way first, on the reading that a session *is* "out of cage to back into
   cage"; the question of whether an animal returned briefly and brought out again resumes
   its session or starts a new one went to the PI rather than being left as an inference,
   and he confirmed it starts a new one. Recorded as his ruling and not as our reading,
   because three of the first four decisions this repo revisited as inferences changed the
   moment somebody asked (CLAUDE.md, "ask, do not file"). **The consequence he weighed and
   accepted:** an animal returned mid-day produces **two session directories and two
   records**, not one record with an unexplained gap — which is the more honest account,
   since nothing downstream could tell such a gap from a session that simply ran long.

2. **Nothing said what time base the mark was in, and as wired the change did not achieve
   the ruling.** `Session.now()` is frame-derived and reads zero at session start, so
   counting transport and chairing needs a mark *before* zero — and `cli.py` passed `0.0`,
   which made out-of-cage time identical to chair time. The under-count the clock replaced
   chair time to remove, reintroduced by the interface, with no test pinning it.
   `welfare.left_cage(seconds_ago, now)` took the number an operator holds; it refused
   the future, and refused longer ago than the subject's own ceiling — which is what caught
   a wall clock handed to a session-relative parameter, and is the same refusal a session
   already past twelve hours gets. **`wlx run --out-of-cage-ago` is required with no
   default**, for the reason `--as WHO` is: a headless run types `0` and means it.
   (**The parameter is `left_cage(at, wall_now, now)` and the flag is `--out-of-cage-at`
   since 2026-09-20** — the PI ruled that a clock time is what an operator reads. The
   time-base argument above is unchanged and the mapping moved *into* `welfare`; what the
   change cost, and what replaces it, is under "The PI's round-2 rulings".)

3. **And then a value that is unordered against every bound.** Found by review after the
   two above were closed, and the sharpest of the three: every guard on this path is an
   *ordered* comparison, and **NaN is `False` against all of them** — not in the future, not
   past the ceiling, not backwards. `left_cage(nan)` made the mark NaN, the duration NaN, and
   `must_stop` answer `None` forever. Reachable from the surface an operator touches:
   `--out-of-cage-ago` was `type=float` and argparse parses `nan`, so `wlx run` ran **400
   rewarded trials, 13.55 mL, a clean summary and no duration limit at all**. A NaN
   `out_of_cage` **ceiling** in a bounded config did the same with an honest mark.

   `bounds._finite` refuses a non-finite value at `Ceiling`, at `Floor` and at
   `Bounds.validate`, so a limit that is not a number cannot be constructed; `welfare`
   refuses one at both ends of the mark and on the computed duration. `math.isfinite`,
   because `calibration._yaml_float` already spells it that way and a second spelling of
   "is this a number" is a second thing to keep in step. This entry said **`inf` was
   always refused correctly**; the next round measured that false — `seconds > inf` is
   `False` for every real duration, so an `inf` ceiling is never exceeded either, and
   only the *mark* route ever refused it. Corrected rather than deleted, because the
   sentence had been repeated twice before anyone checked it.

   Two smaller things went with it. `preflight` took the session clock instead of
   hardcoding `0.0`, which had baked the zero-base assumption into a second place. And
   `left_cage` now refuses `seconds_ago >= ceiling` rather than `>`: an animal out for
   exactly the limit has no room for a trial, and the boundary now meets `must_stop`'s `>`
   instead of overlapping it by one.

4. **And then the same class again, on the surfaces the first two rounds did not touch.**
   Rounds 1–3 were one defect found three times: **a guard on a *limit*, with the
   *measurement* compared against it left unchecked.** `--delivered-today nan` printed
   `supplement: 0.00 mL` for an animal on 10.90 mL against a 20 mL floor — an unmeasured
   day turned into "nothing is owed", in the figure the PI's own floor ruling exists to
   produce. `--set reward_correct=-0.5`, through the real console path, commanded twenty
   rewards of −0.5 mL to the pump. Neither is exotic; both are `type=float`.

   **The fix is the rule, not the two patches:** *an instant is finite; a magnitude is
   finite and not negative* (`bounds._finite`, `bounds._magnitude`). It now applies at
   every door — the limits, the console's offered value, the day's prior total, the
   sync box's delivered figure, the marks, and every clock reading.

   **And the enumeration is checked rather than asserted.** `tests/test_welfare.py`
   lists every numeric entry point with a driver, recomputes that set from the live
   modules, and fails if one is in neither the guarded list nor an exempt list with a
   reason — `tools/mutation_gate.py`'s shape, for parameters. A second test closes its
   one blind spot, an unannotated parameter. **Adding a float-taking method to either
   welfare-critical file now fails the suite until it is guarded or explained.**

   `welfare.py` was cut from 630 to **515 lines / 247 executable** in the same pass,
   with the dated narratives moved into S8 §5.2c and every refusal message kept
   verbatim. Two sentences in it were measured **false** and corrected: that `inf` was
   already refused everywhere (only the mark route refused it), and that `preflight`
   checks the ceiling (it does not; `left_cage` and `must_stop` do).

   **And one PI ruling came out of that round** (2026-09-20). A reward volume of
   **exactly zero** is a quantity, so neither guard refuses it; the question was whether
   a *policy* refusal belonged on top, since a console zeroing the volume leaves every
   subsequent correct trial unpaid. **Answered: allow it, because it is not silent** —
   and because it is a legitimate operational move, pausing reward without ending a
   session. The consequence he weighed and accepted: while it holds, an animal working
   correctly is paid nothing.

   **That makes two console numbers welfare-load-bearing.** `fluid session: 0.00 mL`
   (from `welfare.session_total`) is how an operator sees it, and `supplement` keeps
   reporting the whole floor as owed so the animal is topped up. **A change that stopped
   showing either would turn a permitted operation into a silent one** — a welfare
   regression reached by simplifying a display. The sentence is in `cli.render`,
   `link.Telemetry` and S9a §9 as well as S8 §5.2c, because a P4d-2 or P4d-4 session
   editing a console pane is where it would otherwise be lost. It is also **the one
   place a magnitude of zero is deliberately allowed**, so the rule itself keeps no
   exception.

5. **A verification pass then attacked the tripwire itself, and got past it six
   times.** The enumeration of numeric entry points was real, but the introspection
   that checks it had blind spots: it filtered on `inspect.isfunction`, so a
   `@property` setter, a `@staticmethod` and a `@classmethod` taking a float were
   invisible; its classifier matched only `"float"` or exactly `"int"`, so `int |
   None`, `Optional[int]` and `Decimal` slipped; and it required *an* annotation
   rather than a classifiable one, so `ml: object` passed. **None existed in either
   module** — this was the tripwire, not a live hole — but a tripwire with six blind
   spots is the failure it exists to prevent, one level up. All six are caught now,
   and the fixed test immediately found a real one: `Rig.card: object`, which now has
   a `Card` Protocol beside `Pump`.

   Three claims were also wrong and are corrected. **"Exactly two routes"** by which a
   number could reach a comparison unguarded: there are **at least six**, and the
   other four are named. **`Welfare.deliveries` "never supplied"**: it is a
   constructor field, and `Welfare(deliveries=-7)` is accepted — harmless, since
   nothing compares it, but the true reason is that it is a *count*, not a magnitude;
   the three clock fields carried the same overstatement. And **§5.2c earned nine
   refusals while the two files have twenty-three** — the other fourteen are
   structural and lived in prose a reviewer would not find from the code. **S8 §5.2d
   is now a table of all twenty-three**, first clause verbatim and greppable, each
   with the failure it was written against; a test keeps it in step with the code in
   both directions.

   `bounds.py` got `welfare.py`'s treatment, which it had not had: **327 → 285 lines,
   99 executable**, narrative moved to S8, every refusal message verbatim. And `wlx
   run` now refuses *every* bad welfare value with a message rather than a traceback —
   `--out-of-cage-ago nan` was wrapped and `--delivered-today nan` was not (that flag
   is `--out-of-cage-at TIME` since 2026-09-20 and refuses a non-time at the parser).

`welfare` and `bounds` re-swept at a 560 baseline — 28 names, **0 survivors, 0 skips, 0
timeouts, 1 `NOT MUTABLE`** (`Card.emit`, a Protocol stub whose implementations live in
`dio`; the documented category, not a survivor). Full account in
`welfare-clock-report.md`.


**Also, same class as the work just completed:** `taskd.Session.refusals` was the third
list growing without bound under the same untrusted peer as `ZmqLink.refused` and
`Telemetry.refusals`. Capped at `link.REFUSAL_HISTORY` with the discards counted into
`Telemetry.refusals_dropped`, consistently with the other two.

**`SCHEMA` is 3.** `Staged.bounded` stopped meaning "already live" and became "checked
against a welfare ceiling rather than the task's `Param`" — a field that still decodes and
no longer means what it did, which is exactly the case that number exists for: a console
built against schema 2 renders a just-lowered reward volume as `ALREADY IN EFFECT`.

### The whole-branch review of P4d-1, and its fixes

**The last pass before the PI sees it.** Seven tasks had each been reviewed on their own;
this reviewed the branch as a whole and found six things no single task's review could
have, because each of them is about two places disagreeing. In commit order:

- **CI would have been red on every job at the first push.** P4d-1 added the `console`
  extra and neither CI job installed it. Measured with `zmq`/`msgpack` blocked:
  `9 failed, 412 passed`. Worse on the mutation job, which escalates to a full sweep on a
  `pyproject.toml` change and would have aborted at `tools/mutate.py`'s "suite is not green
  to begin with" with no coverage evidence at all. **A test count is a claim about an
  environment**, and "421, green" was a claim about a developer machine. The Tests row
  above now says what it is green *with*.
- **A welfare-bounded change applies immediately and was displayed as `staged`.** Four
  documents said it deferred to the next trial boundary; only one test said otherwise.
  Measured: a queued `SetParameter(reward_correct, 0.30)` against a starting 0.15 has
  trial 0 — the trial in that same pass — commanding 0.30 mL, while its
  `parameter_changes.jsonl` row lands between trial 0 and trial 1. The ceiling holds and
  nothing lands mid-trial, so this is attribution, not over-delivery — but **the record is
  off by one trial for fluid attribution**. Fixed by documentation only, in all four
  places plus three more carrying the same claim. It was then put to the PI as a question,
  and **answered the same day: it defers** — see "The PI's four decisions" above, which
  reverses the documentation this bullet describes.
- **`Refused` could not survive the wire and nothing could tell.** `decode` was correct,
  but the suite's only round-trip ran on an empty `refusals` tuple — deleting the rebuild
  left `421 passed, 0 failed`. Two tests now, one of them `render(decode(encode(...)))`,
  because the chain is what a console walks.
- **The refusal feed grew without bound, driven by an untrusted peer.** Capped at 50 per
  source with the drops counted and printed; `SCHEMA` → 2.
- **Nothing constrained the bind address.** `wlx run --link tcp://0.0.0.0:...` was accepted
  in silence, which voids S9a §7's entire justification for trusting a command's actor.
  Loopback unless `--link-allow-remote`, with **P4d-3** named at the bind as what real
  authentication waits on.
- **Found on the way:** `ZmqLink.__init__` abandoned its `Context` if `bind` raised —
  a port already in use is the ordinary case — which is the state that makes the suite stop
  terminating. It cost a 600 s hang here before it was closed.

Six minors too, of which two were the same rule applied in one place and not its twin: an
unchecked `partition("=")` in `--set` after `--link` had been hardened, and a measurement
disclaimer in one test file and not the other.

`bounds.py` and `welfare.py` remain untouched by this branch — checked against its own
base, `8693299`, not against `main`. The full report is in
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-19-p4d1-console-link/final-fix-report.md` (untracked;
`.superpowers/` is gitignored).

### The console is a web application now, and `wl-works` lists the devices

**ADR-0008, accepted by the PI 2026-09-19.** It supersedes S9a §1's PySide6 decision and
S9 §8, and it came from the PI asking whether the experimenter interface could be reached
through `wl-works`. Three findings decided it, each read from source rather than recalled:

- **`wl-works` already specifies the directory.** Its Plan 10 design opens *"It is not a
  dashboard. It is a control plane for lab machines, with a status board as its read
  half"*, and specifies `/infrastructure`, a responder contract and health readings. The
  tab does not need inventing.
- **But `wl-works` must not hold the authority.** Plan 10 §4.1, deliberately the first
  line of its protocol document: *"Publishing an action makes it available to every member
  of the lab. There is no permission model on the app side."* §6.2 defends that with *"the
  host is the real boundary anyway"*. On a preprocessing server the worst case is wasted
  compute; on a rig it is fluid, or a session started on an animal nobody is standing next
  to. So the box authenticates, the box records who asked, and `wl-works` carries a link
  and readings — which is the exclusion `architecture.md` already recorded, now with the
  reason attached to it.
- **"A server on the rig" stopped distinguishing the options.** S9 §8 rejected a web UI
  because it would put a server on the rig; `labhost` (P4c) and Plan 10's responder both
  put one there by design. What survives is S9 §1 — the hot loop serves no requests —
  which a console process beside `taskd` honours either way.

**LAN-only** (PI: *"off-site is not necessary. at least now it isn't"*), so nothing
bridges and a `wl-works` outage cannot cost an operator the console mid-session. Nothing
forecloses off-site later: a box that owns its origin and its auth is unchanged by a route
placed in front of it.

**One thing is gated on a measurement, not on an opinion: protocol V11.** S9a §2's
replica pane — the animal's screen with gaze and windows drawn on top, at display rate —
is the one thing PyQtGraph was chosen for, and this ADR claims nothing about whether a
browser carries it. V11 measures it over the LAN with no rig. If it fails, the fallback is
a native path for that pane, not a second console.

**The kiosk's iPad is the next decision** and is deliberately not made here — see
`next-session.md` §3d — **answered on 2026-09-19; see the console design above.**

### The console design, brainstormed and settled

S9a now carries the whole control-system design in §6–§10, and **two of S9's open items
closed by being dissolved rather than answered.** Decisions, each the PI's:

- **Identity is OAuth2 against `wl-works`** — which turned out to be configuration rather
  than development. Read from their source: `src/lib/auth.ts` registers better-auth's
  `mcp()` plugin, which *is* the OAuth provider in 1.7.1 and serves the `/oauth2/*`
  surface Zulip already consumes, with revocation proven end to end. The ask drafted in
  `pending-wl-works-amendments.md` is "register a client".
- **Two entry points, one console.** Via `wl-works` for attributed actions; **locally as a
  permanent peer**, never an emergency hatch, so an intranet outage cannot cost an
  operator the console with an animal in the chair. `Actor` is two types — `Verified` and
  `Local` — because a forgeable name is worse than no name.
- **No write lock** (S9 open item 1, closed). Anybody attached has full access. Safe
  because **`bounds` is the welfare boundary, not the lock**: magnitudes are
  ceiling-checked whoever asks, fluid is a floor with nothing to race against, mappings
  are versioned, stop is idempotent. Visibility — presence, a live change feed, and
  **staged changes visible to everyone** — replaces coordination.
- **Preflight: unknown proceeds on a recorded acknowledgement; only a failure blocks**
  (S9 open item 2, closed). One rule, no exceptions, shaped against a gate that cries wolf
  and gets routed around. **It carries a dated dependency**: it is safe only while the
  pump driver may not be written before V10, and S9a §10 says so in the place someone
  would have to grep.
- **RT is approximate online and real offline.** `rt_approx_ms`, never `rt_ms`. An
  earlier proposal to wire hardware response lines was withdrawn — it would have changed a
  board on the strength of reasoning rather than a measurement, which is the thing this
  repo forbids.
- **The kiosk's animal-facing screen is an attached panel with a wired touch sensor**, not
  an iPad: a touch arriving over WiFi cannot be strobed promptly, and the offline join is
  the method. The iPad becomes the *experimenter's* window, which ADR-0008 already gives
  for free. **And the cage-side deployment gets a reduced sync module** — reversing S13
  §2's "no sync box" — which also gives `wl-juicer`'s dose and witness lines the home its
  spec designed them for.

**One thing found and deliberately not fixed here:** the session directory carries
`trials.jsonl`, `config.json`, `parameter_changes.jsonl` and `eye_calibration.yaml` but
**no event-code table**, so nothing downstream can name a code without checking out the
task at the recorded version and re-deriving it. `wlx review` builds that table already.
It is a P4c item, not a console one.

### The console link ships (P4d-1), and three things about it stay open

Built on `p4d1-console-link` — see this file's banner above for how to find the
branch's own commits (deliberately not a count; see why there) — on top of
`p4b-session-management`, itself still unmerged and waiting on the welfare review
below. `Session` gains a `link` field, drained and published **once per trial
boundary and never per frame** — proved by a test, not only argued (the plan's Task
4 Step 6). `link.py` (new, 672 lines) holds the telemetry message and its schema
(`Telemetry`, `Staged`, `Refused`, `SCHEMA`), the commands a console sends back
(`SetParameter`, `Stop`), the port (`Link`, with `Absent`/`Simulated` as peers exactly
as in `dio.py`), and the one live transport — `ZmqLink`/`ZmqConsole` over ZMQ PUB/SUB
+ REQ/REP, msgpack, ADR-0003's transport untouched. `cli.py` gains `wlx run --link
PUB,REP` and a new subcommand, `wlx console --sub PUB --req REP --as WHO [--set
NAME=VALUE] [--stop]`, a terminal client. **`link.py` carries no ceiling, no clock and
no pump and stayed off the welfare-critical list under review** — the surface is
still exactly `bounds.py` and `welfare.py`.

**S9a §9's one rule, enforced structurally rather than by care.** Every `Telemetry`
field is read from `welfare`, `tally` or `scheduler` — `Telemetry.of` recomputes
nothing — and unknown is `None`, never a confident `0`, following
`welfare.shortfall()`'s own refusal to claim an unmeasured day went well.

**Two Criticals were found and fixed before this shipped, both about a *sequence* of
commands rather than one command in isolation** — S9a §8's ordinary case,
`--set X --stop`, is two commands. A REQ socket refuses a second `send()` before the
first reply is read, so the second command raised until `send()` was made to read the
previous reply lazily, one send behind. And `drain()` used to decode a command before
replying to it, so one undecodable packet — a newer console against an older
`SCHEMA`, a realistic case since the wire is versioned by design, not only
corruption — propagated an exception out of the trial loop *and* left the REP socket
owing a reply, wedging every command after it too; fixed by replying unconditionally
before decoding, and turning a bad packet into a `Refused` entry (the transport-layer
twin of `Session.refusals`) rather than dropping it.

**Mutation sweeps, read rather than trusted (CLAUDE.md; trap 7's shape is exactly
what "read the output" guards against):**

Re-run in full after the whole-branch review's fixes, since those added two functions
(`_binds_beyond_this_machine`, `_value`) and seventeen tests:

```
python3 tools/mutate.py --all --returns None wl_expcontroller/link.py
  baseline: 438 passed in 25.01s -- 15 functions, all caught (of, encode, decode,
  _encode_command, _decode_command, publish, drain, queue,
  _binds_beyond_this_machine, __init__, close, __enter__, __exit__, send,
  receive) -- restored: 438 passed in 14.10s

python3 tools/mutate.py --all --returns None wl_expcontroller/taskd.py
  baseline: 438 passed in 14.05s -- 16 functions, all caught (__post_init__,
  directory, now, head_fixed, head_released, set, staged, _command, _params,
  _apply_staged, _load, _plan, _agent, make, run, publish) -- restored: 438 passed
  in 21.40s

python3 tools/mutate.py --all --returns None wl_expcontroller/cli.py
  baseline: 438 passed in 16.24s -- 7 functions, all caught (_load_trial,
  _load_allocation, _load_bounds, _clock, _value, render, main) -- restored: 438
  passed in 13.58s
```

**Zero `SURVIVED`, zero `SKIPPED`, zero `NOT MUTABLE`, no hang, across all three
modules — 38 functions, each `caught` by a real assertion failure** (`__post_init__`
and `_load_allocation` each fail 45+ of the 438 tests; the narrowest,
`head_released` and `_clock`, fail exactly one — the range a coverage tool should
show, not a flat number). Full transcripts in
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-19-p4d1-console-link/task-7-report.md` for the first run and
`final-fix-report.md` beside it for this one.

**Swept again after the welfare-clock rulings**, over `welfare`, `bounds`, `taskd` and
`scheduler` at a 467-test baseline — **54 target names, 0 survivors, 0 skips, 0 NOT
MUTABLE, and 0 timeouts**, every line a real `N failed`. Full transcripts in
`welfare-clock-report.md` beside the other two. Two findings the sweep produced rather
than confirmed, both now fixed and both of the kind the harness exists for:

1. **`taskd.Session.returned_to_cage` SURVIVED.** It was wired to `welfare` and called
   by nothing and tested by nothing — `bounds.check_delivery`'s failure exactly, a path
   that reads as present because it exists. It now has a test that drives it the way a
   console would, and the test also pins why `run()` must *not* call it: when the loop
   ends the animal is still in the chair, and the release, the unchairing and the walk
   back are all inside the twelve hours.
2. **`Scheduler.record` and `Scheduler.advance` each reported `caught … timed out after
   300s`** — the harness noticing a hang, not a test noticing a defect, which is trap 7's
   shape again. `record` hung because `test_scheduler.py` drove a block with `while not
   scheduler.finished:`, a loop that trusts the code under test; it counts to a finite
   bound and asserts now. `advance` hung because `run()`'s block-advance `continue` runs
   no trial and moves no clock, so a scheduler that reported `finished` and then stayed
   put would spin with an animal in the chair and nothing on any console changing.
   `run()` now **counts** block transitions and refuses the one past `len(blocks) - 1`.
   Counted rather than compared on purpose: a plan may legitimately list the same `Block`
   object twice — "multiple blocks of the same tasks" is the PI's own description — so a
   guard asking whether the block *changed* would abort one of those sessions. Both
   functions now report `6 failed` and `25 failed`.

**Three things found and deliberately left open, recorded rather than fixed —
`docs/next-session.md` §6 has the full account, and item 3 is also in §1 beside the
`bounds.py`/`welfare.py` review already waiting:**

1. **A pump fault publishes nothing.** `welfare.deliver` raises, `Rig` deliberately
   does not swallow it, and the exception propagates past `Session.run`'s `finally`
   with no final `Telemetry` frame and no `stopped_because` — a console watching a
   rig break, unattended, cage-side, sees only silence. What a console should show
   when the rig itself is faulty is a design question for a later slice.
   **Closed the same day by the PI's second decision** — see "The PI's four
   decisions" above. This paragraph is what it was closed against.
2. **A change staged on a session's literal last pass is never applied** —
   `_apply_staged()` gets no further pass once the loop decides to stop. The final
   frame still shows it `staged` beside `STOPPED:`, an implicit signal rather than
   silence, but `--set X --stop` over real sockets does not land both commands in
   the same `drain()` batch — Task 6's reviewer reproduced this 20/20 times (not
   committed under `docs/measurements/`, and not a claim about this system's timing;
   the number says the ordering held every time it was tried, nothing about speed) —
   so the obvious way to hit this on purpose does not. Residual risk: a
   `SetParameter` landing on whichever pass a welfare ceiling or "every block
   finished" resolves on. **Widened the same day by the PI's first decision**: a
   welfare-bounded name used to be immune, because `Session.set` moved the ceiling at
   drain time and only the record row was lost; now the value is staged too, so such
   a command on the stopping pass is dropped entirely. Still open, now on the reward
   path — `docs/next-session.md` §6 item 2 carries the full note.
3. **`wlx console --set reward_correct=...` is the first person-invocable path that
   moves a reward limit** (`Session.set` validates, `_apply_staged` → `bounds.set` at
   the next boundary, since 2026-09-19). `cli.py` does not become
   welfare-critical — the ceiling is still enforced in `bounds.py` alone — but the
   capability is new and welfare-facing, and CLAUDE.md wants a human lab member on
   it before merge, same as `bounds.py`/`welfare.py`.

### The branch was pushed, and the gate caught something real

`docs/next-session.md` said the first thing to do was push the branch and watch the
runs. That happened on 2026-09-13, and **the run failed** — which is the entry justifying
why it was the first thing to do. Run `34769913502`: pytest green on 3.11, 3.12 and
3.13, then the mutation gate escalated to a full sweep as predicted, ran for 1h46m, and
printed

```
MUTATION GATE FAILED: calibration, saccade
  SKIPPED   recenter    could not find recenter
  SKIPPED   detect      could not find detect
```

**Not survivors.** A skip fails the gate on purpose (`tools/mutate.py`): a function the
harness cannot mutate is a function whose coverage is unproven, and the whole point of
this tool is that it never reports safety it has not measured.

### What was underneath it was worse than a red build

The pattern's `\([^)]*\)` cannot cross a `)` inside a parameter list, and both
functions have one — `params: Params = Params()` and
`left: tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0)`. `saccade.detect` therefore matched nothing.
**`calibration.recenter` matched part of its own signature**, so the mutation was
inserted into the parameter list, the suite reported collection errors, and `mutate`
read the non-zero exit as `caught`.

So that function had been reported covered *for as long as it existed*, and the nightly
on `main` was still printing `caught recenter  2 errors in 0.82s` on 2026-09-18 —
verified by reading run `35323903984`'s log rather than by reasoning about the tool.
With the fix it reports **`caught recenter  5 failed, 374 passed`**: a real test
failure, the first this function has ever produced.

`saccade.detect` is the opposite case and worth separating: the nightly shows
`caught detect  7 failed, 300 passed`, so it was genuinely covered and the stricter
pattern of 2026-09-06 **regressed** it. One fix, two different lies.

### The pattern is gone

`_neuter_source` asks `ast` where a body starts. Three regex failures in a row were
each the fix for the last — a trailing comment defeated the match, then a same-line body
matched and produced a `SyntaxError`, then a nested paren ended the signature early —
and that sequence is the argument: `body[0]` **is** the body, and no punctuation in a
signature can move it. What is left to decide is only where the inserted line goes: a
docstring is stepped over rather than displaced, and a body on the signature's own line
is refused for that definition while its siblings are still neutered.

### And two functions that were never on the list at all

`_function_names` matched `^ *def ([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\(`, which **cannot spell a
capital letter**. `photometry._XYZ` and `task.FixPoint` had therefore never been mutated
once, and nothing in any output said so — they were simply absent. Found by replacing
the pattern with the parser and diffing the target lists. Fourth instance of this
harness's recurring shape: quietly examining nothing and reporting success.

### And the first thing the fixed harness found: `task.FixPoint` is covered by nothing

`SURVIVED  FixPoint  379 passed in 13.61s`. Neuter the task vocabulary's
fixation-point shortcut and **the whole suite still passes**, because nothing in this
repository uses it: no test, and none of the three reference tasks, though S1a §6
settles it as vocabulary and S1 §5.1's worked example is `FIX = FixPoint(at=(0, 0),
size=0.3)`. It had never been mutated in its life, so nothing had ever had the chance
to say so.

It has tests now (`tests/test_task.py`, which also gives `task` a test file the
selective gate can map to it). But the more useful finding is the disagreement it
exposes: **the spec's worked example uses a shortcut none of our worked examples use.**
Either the reference tasks should spell fixation points the way a task author will, or
the vocabulary is carrying a name for a thing nobody reaches for. Worth one decision,
and it is a task-layer decision rather than a repair, so it is not made here.

### The cheap win from §3b, taken

Every definition of a name is neutered together, so a name six worlds implement ran six
identical sweeps — six full runs of the suite, same input, same result. `_function_names`
now returns each name once: `run.py` 24 targets → 12, `dio.py` 14 → 6, `welfare.py`
17 → 14, `calibration.py` 24 → 22. Across those eight modules 120 → 94. It changes no
result; it halves the cost of the modules with protocol implementations.

## What moved on 2026-09-06

### The thing worth reading first: fluid has a floor, not a ceiling

**Asked of the PI on 2026-09-06 and answered:** *"there is never a ceiling for fluid
reward. only a floor (which can be supplemented after the training/rec session to
reach)."*

Every fluid limit in this repository was built the wrong way round. `bounds` refused a
delivery that would put the day past its "budget", `welfare` stopped the session on
that refusal, and S8 §4 said *"daily fluid budget"* — which is the phrase that made the
reading available and is now corrected in place. Under this lab's protocol a fluid
ceiling **withholds fluid an animal earned in order to satisfy a limit nobody set**,
and stops the session partway through doing it.

What replaced it:

- **`bounds.Floor` is a different type from `bounds.Ceiling`**, and the daily figure
  lives in `Bounds.minima` rather than `Bounds.ceilings`. Same type for both is exactly
  how a minimum came to be compared with `>`: a floor stored as a ceiling reads as one
  at every call site.
- **`bounds.shortfall(name, delivered_today)`** replaces `check_delivery`. It answers
  *how much is still owed*, never *may I deliver*.
- **Nothing refuses a delivery on volume.** The per-delivery magnitude keeps its
  ceiling, enforced when a console *sets* it — which is the right place, since the
  magnitude is a configuration decision and a task can only name it.
- **An unknown day no longer refuses reward.** S8 §5.2's fail-closed rule followed from
  a ceiling; under a floor the argument runs the other way, and the one thing an
  uncountable day must not do is stop paying an animal that is working. `shortfall()`
  answers `None` rather than zero, because a day nobody measured is not a day that went
  well, and `wlx run` prints that as `supplement: UNKNOWN`.

**This is what "ask, do not file" is for.** The question was put to the PI as a
question at the moment the code forced it, and the answer overturned a model that had
been in the spec since M0, had passed its own tests, and had just been wired into every
session. An open-items table would have recorded it and the wrong model would have
shipped.

---

**P4b: the session, and the two guardrails that were not wired to anything.**

The headline is not a feature. `bounds`' fluid check — the welfare-critical one — was
called by nothing outside its own tests, and `run.py` resolved both
`Mark` and `Reward` into nothing at all, behind a comment saying they "belong to the
I/O layer, which has no simulator yet". **`dio.Simulated` had existed for five days.**
So the M1 gate ran a thousand trials, scored them correct, **strobed no event codes
and delivered no reward**, and 307 tests passed. A session with no codes cannot be
aligned to any recording; an animal that is not paid cannot say so. Both failures are
invisible in every artifact the session produces. Now pitfall **P21**.

- **`welfare.py`, the second welfare-critical module.** The day's fluid total
  (including what another deployment already delivered — S8 §5.2b), the restraint
  clock, the `Pump` port, and **`Rig`, which is what a `Reward` action reaches**. The
  split from `bounds.py` is what keeps each reviewable: `bounds` is pure limits with
  no clock and no hardware, and `welfare` is the one file that has to be read to
  answer *can anything deliver reward without the day's accounting seeing it*.
- **`run.Effects`.** A world answers questions; a mark and a reward answer none, so
  they leave through a separate port. **The default refuses.** Wiring it turned 12
  green tests red, and every one of those was a test running a rewarding task whose
  rewards went nowhere — which is the clearest possible statement of the bug.
- **A pump fault is not absorbed.** A solenoid that will not answer is a broken rig,
  and swallowing it would produce a session's worth of correct trials nobody was paid
  for. `Rig` had a second branch catching a fluid ceiling and stopping the session at
  the next trial boundary; the PI's correction removed the premise, and the shape is
  recorded in its docstring because it is the right shape for any *future* stopping
  condition that arrives mid-trial: never raise out of the frame loop, because that
  aborts a trial the animal completed.
- **`taskd` runs blocks.** `scheduler.py` was mutation-clean, handled quotas, requeue
  and criterion transitions, and nothing imported it — so nothing ever advanced past
  the first block, and `_index` was never incremented in the module's whole life.
  `advance()`/`done` exist now and reset the counters and the criterion window,
  because a criterion carried across a block boundary is met on evidence from a
  different task configuration.
- **A flat run of N trials is the block session with one block.** Not a second loop: a
  second loop is a second place for the ceilings to be checked differently.
- **One ceiling ends a session, and it is time out of the cage** — from the animal
  leaving its home cage to going back in, bounded at twelve hours (PI, 2026-09-19).
  **Fluid is not one.** **Chair time is not one either, since 2026-09-19**, and
  neither is a trial count: `max_trials` is gone and chair time is recorded beside
  the limit rather than being it. A rig session refuses to start without the
  out-of-cage mark; a cage-side one declares `CAGE_SIDE` and has no duration
  bound at all. A `RIG_CHAIRED` one carries the mark, no head-fixation, and reports
  restraint as **absent rather than zero**. See "The welfare clock, and the four rulings that reshaped it".
  **History, not current fact:** when this was written the session clock was derived
  from frames rather than the wall, and this line called that what kept "stops at its
  duration ceiling" deterministic, and the honest choice on a rig, where frames *are*
  the clock. **P4d-2a (2026-09-26, spec §10) took that base off every welfare
  duration**: in the simulator frames outran the wall, so the default `rig-fixed` path
  could not record its return. Out-of-cage, restraint and the limit check now read
  `Session.wall_now()` — the wall as read once at session creation, carried forward on
  a steady clock that counts the time the host is asleep (`welfare.SessionClock`, since
  the slice's final review) — and the frame clock times trials and nothing else. A simulated
  dry run reaches its ceiling only in real time; tests that need the ceiling inject a
  wall clock.
- **`HEAD_FIXED`/`HEAD_RELEASED` are strobed** (4128/4129). Restraint is the one
  welfare quantity with no hardware line, so the codes *are* its durable record —
  which is why they stayed when chair time stopped bounding anything — **for
  `RIG_FIXED` only** since 2026-09-20. **The out-of-cage marks get no codes**, ruled
  2026-09-20: operator-entered rather than measured, so a hardware timestamp would add
  precision to a number that never had it (S8 item 8, closed).
- **The terminal `Marker` is emitted by the framework**, not the task: a task declares
  an `Outcome` and never a marker. Without it a recording has no trial boundaries at
  all, whatever else is in the stream.
- **One validated write path for live parameters.** Validated when offered, applied
  atomically at the next trial boundary, recorded with its origin. A welfare-bounded
  name goes through `bounds.set` and its ceiling; an ordinary one through the task's
  own `Param` declaration — so the console can move reward volume and cannot move it
  past the ceiling, by the same call.
- **Every trial records its block and condition**, not only its resolved parameters.
  Two conditions can resolve to identical values — a catch trial and a signal trial
  differing only in what the task does with them — and an analysis grouping by
  parameters would silently merge them.
- **A session refuses a bounded config belonging to another subject.** Running A
  against B's ceilings is a dose error with a plausible-looking session behind it, and
  nothing downstream compares the two.
- **`wlx run` had no test**, and could not construct a `SessionSpec` after the above.
  It now takes `--bounds` and `--delivered-today`, and reports what it commanded.

**P6's last piece, closed with it.** `gaze.Calibrating` drives a *session* through the
calibration block: it makes each trial's world, collects the fixation from the trials
the task paid for, fits, installs a new mapping version, and writes
`<session>/expcontroller/eye_calibration.yaml` — round-tripped through `wl-preproc`'s
real reader. The composition test that used to stand in for this said in its own
docstring that it was "the shape the driver has to take"; it was, and it was not one.

**The fit averages the hold, not the trial.** A calibration trial *begins* with the
animal looking somewhere else — that is what `Entered("cal")` waits for — so averaging
every sample the trial saw drags each target toward wherever gaze happened to start,
by an amount that depends on how long acquisition took. The resulting map is wrong in
a way neither the conditioning check nor the extent check can see (trap 13's shape
again).

### One ask closed by looking rather than by doing

This file said **"CI is red now and stays red until someone creates a secret"** and
named a PAT only the PI could create. It is not red: `gh run list` shows six
consecutive successes on `main`, and run `33984657820` logs the `wl-preproc` checkout
syncing and `307 passed` with no skips under `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`. The secret exists
and the contract tests run.

Same shape as trap 1, one repo in: **a live ask stayed live because nothing re-read the
thing it was about.** The cost here was small — a person's attention, aimed at a job
already done — but this file is where the next session learns what is blocked, and a
blocker that has cleared is exactly as misleading as one that has not been noticed.

### And the harness was wrong again, in the file it matters most in

`welfare.py`'s first mutation sweep reported every `deliver` **caught**. It was not: the
`Pump` protocol's one-line body (`def deliver(self, ml: float) -> None: ...`) makes the
mutation a `SyntaxError`, every definition of that name is neutered together, so the run
reported collection errors and `mutate` reads any non-zero exit as caught. **The
welfare-critical path from a task's `Reward` to the pump was reported mutation-clean on
the strength of a syntax error.**

Caught by reading the output rather than the exit code: `caught deliver  3 errors in
0.60s` is not the shape of a test failing. With the fix, the same function reports
**16 failed** and `welfare.py` is genuinely mutation-clean. Sixth failure of this tool,
and the second that broke toward a false clean by way of an invalid mutation. Trap 7
carries it.

**And the same class of hole, caught in the new contract test.** The calibration-file
test was written with `pytest.importorskip`, which skips silently — including in CI,
where `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1` exists precisely to turn a missing `wl-preproc` into a
failure. It now uses `test_calibration.py`'s guard. A contract test that is allowed not
to run is not a contract test, which is the same sentence `tests/conftest.py` has
carried since the codec round-trip skipped into a green build.

### Two things this created

**A pump calibration is now an open measurement**, in the same class as the photometer
one. `welfare.Pump` takes millilitres; nothing converts them to solenoid open time, and
`wl-sync`'s board makes clear that the pulse width is ours to choose — it one-shots the
*manual* button at ~199 ms and passes our commanded line straight through the reward-OR
gate. So the number is a per-rig measurement of the pump, and until it exists the real
driver is not written rather than guessed.

**The session grew a world seam.** `Session(world=...)` is where hardware plugs in. It
had to exist for the calibration driver, and it is the first time the claim that "the
loop cannot tell a rig from a simulator" has been exercisable at the session level
rather than the trial level.

---

## What moved on 2026-09-05

**Eye calibration, and a cross-repo blocker that was already unblocked.**

`wl-preproc` had written `eye/expcontroller.py::read_expcontroller_map` — a reader
built for us, in answer to our own handover — and this file still listed the ask as
blocking. **Reading their source rather than our note about it is what found it**,
which is trap 1 for the fourth time. Their reader fixes the schema, so most of what
looked like design work was already decided.

- **The constellation is measured, not chosen** (`tools/calibration_design.py`,
  results under `docs/measurements/dev-machine/`). Thirteen targets: a 3×3 grid at 75%
  of the per-eye field plus four intermediates on the diagonals at half that.
- **75% reach beat 60%, 70%, 85% and 100%** under every optics assumption swept, and
  the intuitive answer — span the whole field — was the *worst* of the five. The panel
  corners sit near 21° eccentricity, outside the disc any task uses, and their leverage
  drags the quadratic away from where stimuli go.
- **Thirteen points buy survival, not accuracy.** At equal animal cost 9, 13 and 25 are
  indistinguishable. Nine points fitting six parameters has three to spare, so losing
  four makes the second-order fit impossible rather than merely poor; thirteen survive
  losing five 95% of the time.
- **`calibration.py`**: per-eye fit, second-order reaching down to affine with a
  reported fallback, three refusals ordered count → conditioning → extent, and the YAML
  file round-tripped through their real reader.
- **`findings.py`**: `Finding` lifted out of `check.py`, because the extent check will
  eventually run the other way round and a circular import was waiting.
- **The CI mutation job now checks out `wl-preproc`.** It did not, so contract tests
  skipped inside the gate that exists to prove tests can fail.

**The rest of P6, later the same day.** The fit had no producer and no consumer;
both now exist.

- **`tasks/calibration.py`** — the block as an ordinary task. It passes all load-time
  checks with **zero findings**, which is the result worth recording: the previous
  four times a real artifact was written against this vocabulary it exposed a gap
  (trap 5), and this time it did not.
- **The map is one versioned object** (S5 §6). `MappingLog` is session-scoped and
  append-only; `Mapping` carries the recentering offset **beside** the coefficients
  rather than folded into them, because a folded constant is indistinguishable from a
  fit that landed there and S5 requires the correction be reversible offline. The file
  folds it, since their schema has nowhere else to put it, and the change log is what
  survives.
- **Version 0 maps nothing.** A session before its calibration block answers `None`
  for degrees rather than zeros — the same refusal `eye.Tracker.state` makes at the
  other end, for the same reason: a tracker reporting the origin scores a hold against
  an empty chair.
- **`gaze.Tracked` joins four modules** and P6's exit condition is met — replayed
  payloads reach a `Window` test in degrees, and a whole thirteen-target block runs
  from scheduled conditions to an installed map.
- **A recentering replaces rather than accumulates**, and a refit drops it. The second
  recentering was measured against gaze the first had already corrected, and an offset
  describes a chair position under the map it was measured against.

### One bug the join found immediately

**Polling gaze in `in_window` kills the trial at frame 7.** `World.display` is the
loop's only per-frame call that lands *before* the frame's guards; `signal` runs next
and `in_window` last. With the poll in `in_window`, `signal` saw a sample nothing had
refreshed, the staleness ceiling expired mid-hold, and the trial scored
`TRACKER_LOST`. It looked exactly like a dropped camera. **Anything a world needs to
do once per frame belongs in `display`**, whose docstring already said so.

### Two ideas measured down, recorded so they are not proposed again

**Holding four targets out as a validation set.** Attractive, and wrong at this budget:
four points at ten fixations each carry a noise floor the size of the error being
estimated, so the held-out number overstates true error by 34–51% *whether the model
fits or not*, with a ±0.05° spread between identical sessions. It cannot estimate
accuracy and it cannot detect misfit, which were the two reasons to want it.

**A ring plus a centre as an acceptable constellation.** `docs/next-session.md` offered
it as equivalent to a grid. It scores 0.1697 — it *passes* the 0.10 gate — while
leaving the quadratic radial term resting on a single contrast between two radii.

---

## What moved on 2026-09-01

Two external reviews (`nhp-neuroscience-reviewer`, `senior-scientist`) found one
thing between them, and it is the entry worth reading if you read nothing else here:
**every load-time check inspected the same object.** Unreachable-state,
unbounded-wait, no-outcome-path and shadowing are four views of the transition graph,
so adding checks raised the count without narrowing the residual class — and the
residual class was tasks whose graph is right and whose *experiment* is wrong. See
trap 9 and pitfall P18.

Seventeen commits. In dependency order:

1. **A hold clocked from the wrong zero** (`67acf4a`). A memory-guided structure with
   a declared 0.3 s delay ran it for **one frame, 4.2 ms**, and scored `CORRECT`.
   Task written correctly, all ten checks passing. Every working-memory delay in the
   v1 inventory was written that way.
2. **The display now exists as state** (`284f7f2`). `Show` persists until `Hide`
   rather than being scoped to its state — the old wording removed a fixation point
   at the exact frame the animal was asked to hold it. Stimuli have names; `Update`
   changes a live one without the offset transient `Hide`+`Show` inserts; a `Window`
   names the stimulus it scores or `REMEMBERED`. Closed **statically and
   dynamically**: the simulated animal now sees the screen and will not look at a
   stimulus that is not there.
3. **Colour** (`045d626`), in CIE xyY and DKL, on the *appearance* so it is a value a
   parameter can swap. Refused without a measured `Calibration`.
4. **Set size as a value** (`470bcec`). `Array` as an appearance, `ItemWindows` as one
   declaration that becomes n windows plus `.target`/`.distractor`.
   `tasks/visual_search.py` — colour pop-out — was unwritable before this.
5. **Anticorrelated RDS and disparity-defined form** (`b86e89f`), plus `Window.eye`,
   which was parsed and dropped.
6. **Intervals from photodiode onset** (`955a6d8`). `After(0.05,
   since=Onscreen("task"))`. An `After` with a `since` is deliberately **not** a time
   bound, and check 4 refuses it as one.
7. **Five outcomes** (`591ba2c`): `CORRECT_REJECT`, `FALSE_ALARM`, `FAULT`,
   `BLINK_BREAK`, `TRACKER_LOST`, with independent blink and tracker graces.
8. **Range-based checks** (`3871a39`): overlapping windows, unreachable timeouts,
   crowded arrays.
9. **The review artifact** (`4e3e023`) grew a display timeline and now names the
   transition that emits each code.
10. **Gaze ingest** (`532fb54`) and **DIO** (`ae07656`) — the pivot.

### Things that were wrong and are now right

- `tasks/visual_search.py` allowed **twelve items on a 3° ring with 4° windows** —
  adjacent centres 1.55° apart, 8° of summed window. A saccade to one distractor
  would have been scored against another. It passed every check that existed the day
  it was committed. Found only when the crowding check was written a day later.
- The **review artifact crashed** on any task using `ItemWindows`, because the
  vocabulary gained a window kind and nothing rendered it.
- **The event-codec round-trip had never run in CI.** `actions/checkout` fetches this
  repo alone, so `importorskip` skipped all nine tests into a green build. They pass
  against `wl-preproc`'s real decoder; nothing was proving it. CI now checks out the
  sibling and sets `WLX_REQUIRE_PREPROC=1`.
- The new outcomes were **not in the requeue set**, so a trial lost to a dropped
  camera left its condition silently one datum short.
- The **mutation harness aborted `--all`** at the first unmatchable signature and
  reported a completed sweep. Fourth blind spot of that shape.

## Work packages

One session each. Each names what to read; **reading more than that is how a session

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-P4d2b-browser-console-design.md`: §1–§4 approved, with the mockup rulings held in §4.0; §4 is b1, on telemetry schema 7; §5 is b2. b3–b6 each get a section as they are designed | that spec | **b2a: the PI's review, then the fast-forward to `main`** |

The box is AMD and rack-mounted, with a priced subtotal of $4,385.96 before the power supply, case and cooler, likely past the accepted ~$4,690; the PI accepts a modest overrun. The fan-out is a custom board that needs a design check (S0 §7.4), not the PRL-4110. 850 nm lamps are required, and the lenses carry 850 ± 25 nm band-pass filters | `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-P9-camera-system-design.md`; S0 §7 | b2a; the camera/encoder library ADR; wl-preproc's `bcam` amendment; hardware (the PI's purchase against S0 §7); **wl-nas, before the cameras go into regular use** (PI) |

Recommendation unchanged; §10 now requires the validation to use OpenIrisDPI's session settings, compare spectra, and include a model eye | P9 spec §8; the spike report | P9's cameras (the validation video) |

**P1–P4b and P4d-1 needed no hardware and are done. P4c and P4d-2 need none either.**
The welfare-critical surface is two files, `bounds.py` and `welfare.py`, and on the
P4d-2a branch four functions in `cli.py`, plus one line inside a fifth, that parse the
out-of-cage marks and decide the departure's confirmation (see the Status table) —
`link.py` and the rest of P4d-1 deliberately stayed off that list — and **both want
a human before merge** — that is the thing on this list that cannot be done by another
session. P4d-1 adds a second, narrower ask to the same review: see "What moved on
2026-09-19" and `docs/next-session.md` §1.

**ADR-0002 is deferred to V1** (2026-08-31): neither display stack is built properly
until a rig can measure both. So P5 is hardware-blocked, and the display spike stays a
spike.

## Outstanding asks on other repositories

One consolidated handover sits in each repo as `HANDOVER-wl-expcontroller.md`.
**Committed in `wl-sync`; written but uncommitted in `wl-preproc` and `wl-works`**,
because the first was on a feature branch with work in flight and the second is owned
by another worker including its remote.

| Repo | Blocking? | Ask |
|---|---|---|
| `wl-sync` | **yes** | The session id is unreadable by a rig host, so `taskd` cannot name its own output directory. And two animals a day means a subject change must mint `_02` |
| ~~`wl-preproc`~~ | ~~**yes**~~ | ~~`read_online_map` reads a `.bhv2` that will not exist~~ **Closed 2026-09-05: they built the second reader** (`eye/expcontroller.py::read_expcontroller_map`, at `c3f6c5e`). Its source fixes the schema, and `tests/test_calibration.py` round-trips against it |
| `wl-preproc` | no | `PARAM_CHANGE` escape; ownership split recorded; codec declared as an artifact; per-trial gaze staleness |
| `wl-works` | no | `prepare-session`, a planned calibration block per session, alerting on bad readings, and an NTP server for lab hosts to synchronize to (ADR-0009) |

Neither blocking item stops P1–P4. Both are built around: codes are allocated in
**4096–32767** (undisputed) and the session id sits behind a provider interface.

## Open measurements this creates

**A pump calibration gates real reward delivery** (new 2026-09-06). `welfare.Pump`
takes millilitres because the ceilings are denominated in millilitres; nothing
converts them to solenoid open time, and that conversion is a per-rig measurement of
the pump and line. `wl-sync`'s board one-shots the **manual** button at ~199 ms and
passes our commanded line straight through the reward-OR gate untouched (their
`hardware/README.md`, 2026-08-15 panel-instrumentation entry), so the pulse width is
ours to choose and the volume it yields is ours to measure. Until it is measured the
real pump driver is **not written**, on the same rule as `nidaqmx`: guessing at it now
means a dose nobody measured. **Protocol V10** in `docs/validation.md`; result goes under
`docs/measurements/`.


**A photometer measurement now gates every chromatic task.** `check` refuses colour
without a `Calibration`, and a real one needs a spectroradiometer or colorimeter on
the actual panel: primaries and background in CIE xyY, gamma, the reachable cone
contrast, and **whose luminous efficiency the luminances were measured against** --
a macaque V(lambda), not a human one, or `lum=0` is isoluminant for nobody in the
room. Result goes under `docs/measurements/`. Until then chromatic tasks will not
load, which is the intended failure: the alternative is a task that runs, looks
convincing, and reports a colour nobody measured.

## Traps

Things that cost something to learn here. Each is a convention in `CLAUDE.md` now.

1. **Read the neighbouring repository's source, not its manifest.** `wl-exptasks`'
   manifest said the event vocabulary was unallocated; `wl-preproc` had a frozen
   codec. This project came within one spec of building a second one. Twice more
   since: `expcontroller/` was already reserved for us by name, and the eye
   calibration model was already fixed.
2. **`wlo validate` cannot catch a false description.** It checks that a published
   name resolves to one publisher, never that what it says is true.
3. **A ring of calibration targets is degenerate** on the second-order basis, because
   points on a circle make the constant, dx² and dy² columns linearly dependent. The
   intuitive pattern silently forecloses second-order calibration.
4. **Clear `__pycache__` when mutating.** Doing it by hand left stale bytecode and
   reported failures against already-correct code. The same staleness the other way
   reports a false *pass*. Use `tools/mutate.py`.
5. **Writing a real task found four gaps specification had not.** Missing vocabulary
   (`GazeHeld`, `SaccadeInto`, transition actions), a checker blind to transitions
   that passed a task emitting an unallocated code, a runner that never resolved
   parameters, and a subject that could not lapse mid-trial. **Write the artifact
   before trusting the machinery that makes it.**
6. **A killed mutation run once left a neutered method on disk, and it was committed
   and pushed** — the timeout bypassed the `finally` that restores, and the commit did
   not re-run the suite. Fixed both ways: the harness writes a sentinel and heals on
   its next run, and the rule stands that **nothing is committed without a green
   suite in the same breath**. `git add -A` after a long-running command is the shape
   of the mistake.
7. **An eighth, 2026-09-26, and this one threw the answer away rather than getting it
    wrong.** `_run_suite` kept pytest's last line. When a flaky test went red on 7 of 41
    unmutated runs in the 09-25 nightly, the log said `1 failed, 673 passed` seven times
    and never which test; and when the same flake landed on 24 mutant runs it added one
    failure to each, which is exactly enough to report a real survivor as `caught`. Now
    every red suite prints its failure lines and every mutant's line ends `<- node ids`.
    **Read the `<-`**: a function caught only by a test that has nothing to do with it
    was not caught. Original entry follows.

    **The mutation harness has now been wrong seven times, and the seventh had been
    lying for as long as the function existed.** `calibration.recenter` and
    `saccade.detect` both take a default argument containing a `)` --
    `left: tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0)`, `params: Params = Params()` -- and the
    pattern's `\([^)]*\)` ends the signature at that inner paren. For `detect` the
    scan then found no colon and the function was simply never matched. For
    `recenter` it found the one in `why: str` and matched **part of the signature**,
    so the mutation was inserted *into the parameter list*: `SyntaxError`, collection
    errors, non-zero exit, `caught`.

    So the module was reported mutation-clean while one of its functions had never
    once been neutered. The nightly on `main` printed `caught recenter  2 errors in
    0.82s` every night, which is the whole tell: two *errors* is not a test failing.

    **Three regex failures in a row, each one the fix for the last.** `[^\n]*` was
    added so a trailing comment could not defeat the match; it swallowed a same-line
    body. `[^:\n]*` fixed that; it could not cross a nested paren. The pattern is gone:
    `_neuter_source` asks `ast` where the body starts, because `body[0]` **is** the
    body and no amount of punctuation in a signature can move it.

    **And the same file had two more functions it had never named.** `_function_names`
    matched `^ *def ([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\(`, which cannot spell a capital letter, so
    `photometry._XYZ` and `task.FixPoint` were not on any target list and no output
    ever said so. Both now come from the parser too. Original entry follows.

    **The mutation harness has now been wrong six times, and the sixth is the one that
    matters most.** A body written on the signature's own line -- `def deliver(self,
    ml: float) -> None: ...` -- cannot have a statement inserted after it, so the
    mutation produced a **`SyntaxError`**. The suite then reported *collection errors*,
    `mutate` reads any non-zero exit as the mutation being caught, and every definition
    sharing that name was reported covered without a single test being consulted.

    The name in question was `deliver`, in `welfare.py`: **the welfare-critical path
    from a task's `Reward` action to the pump**, reported as mutation-clean on the
    strength of a syntax error. Found by reading the output rather than the exit code
    -- `caught deliver  3 errors in 0.60s` is not the shape of a test failing, and four
    identical lines for four different definitions is not the shape of four tests
    failing either.

    The offending clause was itself a fix: `[^\n]*` after the colon was added so a
    trailing comment could not defeat the match (see the fifth failure, below), and it
    swallowed a same-line body with the same appetite. Now `[ \t]*(?:#[^\n]*)?` --
    a comment is not a body -- with `tests/test_mutate.py` asserting that both cases
    still behave and that the mutation **parses**. Original entry follows.

    **The mutation harness has now been wrong five times, and the fifth broke the
    other way.** The first four were false *clean* -- quietly examining nothing and
    reporting success. The fifth was a false *alarm*: neutering inserts
    `return None` at the top of a function whose body was already `return None`,
    which changes nothing, so the suite passed and the harness called it a SURVIVOR.
    Three no-op `display` bodies meant **the mutation gate could never go green**,
    and this file carried the discrepancy as a footnote instead of a bug. Now proved
    from the AST and reported as `NOT MUTABLE`, with `tests/test_mutate.py` testing
    the narrowness rather than the feature -- a category that does not fail the build
    is precisely the shape of the first four, so what is tested is that it refuses
    every case but the one. Original entry follows.

    **The mutation harness has been wrong four times, always the same way** — quietly
   examining nothing and reporting success. It matched only `_`-prefixed names, then
   only module-level `def`, then gave up entirely on a name defined twice, then
   **aborted the whole `--all` sweep at the first signature it could not match** --
   `def __repr__(self) -> str:  # pragma: no cover`, whose trailing comment defeated
   the pattern -- so every function after it went unmutated and the run read as
   complete. Each time it found real gaps once fixed, including a dead `per_eye`
   method and an untested CLI. **If a module reports few functions, distrust the tool
   before the code**, and a miss is now reported rather than fatal.
8. **A pure hazard model cannot produce non-engagement**, and hazards are rates
   per second — a per-frame number describes a different animal at every refresh rate. It fires eventually given
   enough frames, so `NO_FIXATION` — the commonest real abort — was unreachable in
   every simulated session until engagement became per-trial.

9. **Every check inspected the same object, so a whole defect class was invisible.**
   Unreachable-state, unbounded-wait, no-outcome-path, shadowing — all three views of
   the transition graph. Nothing modelled what was *on the screen*, when, or for how
   long, so the residual class was **"correct graph, wrong experiment"**, and the
   first reference task carried one: `Show` was scoped to its state, so the fixation
   point was removed at the exact frame the animal was asked to hold it. The task read
   correctly, all ten checks passed, and 2,000 simulated trials reported clean.
   Fixed by making `Show` persist until `Hide`, giving stimuli names, coupling each
   `Window` to the stimulus it scores, and adding both a static check
   (`nothing-to-look-at`) and a dynamic one (a simulated animal will not look at a
   stimulus that is not there). Found by review 2026-08-31.
   **The general lesson: ask what a gate is looking at, not how many gates there are.**


10. **A feature that stops a human writing something out also stops a human reviewing
    it.** `Array` and `ItemWindows` exist so set size is a value rather than a
    structure — which means the items and their windows are never typed and never
    read. `tasks/visual_search.py` shipped allowing twelve items on a 3° ring with 4°
    windows: adjacent centres 1.55° apart, 8° of summed window, so a saccade to one
    distractor would have been scored against another. It passed every check that
    existed the day it was committed. Found only when the crowding check was written.
    See P20.

11. **The review artifact is the review, so what it omits is unreviewed.** It rendered
    stimulus position and disparity and nothing about time — while every defect the
    reviews found was about *when* something was on screen. It also raised
    `AttributeError` on any task using `ItemWindows`, because the vocabulary gained a
    window kind and nothing rendered it, and no test rendered a task with an array.
    **When you extend the vocabulary, extend the artifact in the same commit.**


12. **The mutation harness can hang, and a hang is how the sentinel gets used.**
    Neutering `Scheduler.record` stops the counts advancing, so a test running a
    block to completion never finishes; the suite hung, an outer timeout killed the
    harness past its `finally`, and a neutered `scheduler.py` was left on disk. The
    sentinel restored it correctly on the next check — it works — but the fix is a
    per-run timeout in the tool, and a mutation that hangs now counts as caught,
    because a suite that no longer terminates has certainly noticed it.
    **Never `git add` immediately after a mutation run that did not print `restored:`.**

13. **A gate can be blind to the thing that matters most, by design, and still read
    as passing.** `wl-preproc`'s conditioning metric is scale-invariant on purpose --
    without it, an ordinary grid reads as degenerate for no reason but where the
    screen origin sits. The cost is that **it cannot see how far the targets reach**:
    a 3×3 shrunk to 60% of the field scores 0.2277, *identical* to one spanning it,
    then understates its own error by 3.0× against 1.5×. The calibration procedure had
    conditioning as its only acceptance criterion, so this was the whole gate. Same
    lesson as trap 9 from the other direction: ask what a gate is looking at, and then
    ask what it was deliberately built not to look at.

14. **PyYAML reads `1e-17` as a string.** YAML 1.1's float pattern requires a decimal
    point before the exponent, so `yaml.safe_load("a: 1e-17")` returns `'1e-17'`, and
    a quadratic calibration coefficient small enough to render that way is entirely
    ordinary. The file would have been declined, or silently rescued by pydantic's
    coercion, depending on the reader's mood. `calibration._yaml_float` inserts the
    point; a test proves it end to end through their reader rather than only against
    the helper. **Any hand-written YAML in this repo needs the same care.**

15. **The four calibration decisions that looked like design were already made.**
    The model, the basis column order, the conditioning thresholds, and the entire
    file schema all live in `wl-preproc`'s source -- including a reader written
    specifically for us that this checkpoint still listed as an outstanding blocking
    ask. Trap 1, fourth occurrence. The pattern is now specific enough to state as a
    rule: **before designing anything that crosses a repo boundary, grep their source
    for our own name.**

16. **A backslash inside an f-string expression is a syntax error before 3.12, and
    only CI can see it.** `review.py` had `f"...{' \u2192 '.join(x)}..."`, which PEP
    701 legalised in 3.12 -- so every local interpreter here parses it happily, and
    `ast.parse(..., feature_version=(3, 11))` does **not** reproduce the error. This
    package declares `requires-python = ">=3.11"`, so `wlx review` was unimportable on
    its own declared floor for four days. **The 3.11 CI job is the only detector**,
    which is worth knowing the next time it is tempting to trim the matrix.

17. **Nothing was pushed for four days, and every claim about CI was therefore
    unverified.** The 09-01 checkout fix, the 3.11 syntax error, the pytest
    invocation difference and the mutation gate's false alarm were all sitting in
    unpushed commits. The first push found four bugs in two runs. **A green local
    suite says nothing about CI, and `git log origin/main..main` is the check** --
    a checkpoint that says "CI does X" when X has never executed is the same class of
    error as a stale checkpoint, and harder to see.

18. **A hand-maintained list of things to check is a list that is wrong.** The CI
    mutation gate enumerated its modules in YAML, so a module joined the gate only if
    someone remembered to add it. Three never were -- `bounds`, `scheduler`,
    `findings` -- and `bounds` is the welfare-critical file, the one CLAUDE.md
    requires a human to review before merge. Nothing detected it for a week, because
    nothing compared the list against the directory. `tools/mutation_gate.py` now
    derives the set from disk and **fails if a module is in neither its gated nor its
    exempt list**, so a new module is a build failure rather than a silent omission.
    The same shape as trap 7: the question is not whether the gate passes, it is
    whether the gate is looking at everything it claims to.

19. **A contract test's counterparty moves while you work, and the two halves fail
    differently.** On 2026-09-05 the local `wl-preproc` checkout advanced onto a
    feature branch where `detect_engbert_kliegl` had gained an `fs_hz` argument, while
    `origin/main` -- **which is what CI checks out** -- still had the older signature.
    The saccade contract test therefore failed locally and passed in CI, for a change
    to neither detector's behaviour. Two lessons, and the second is the useful one.
    A signature is not the contract; the intervals are, so the test adapts its *call*
    and keeps asserting the behaviour on both. And **a local sibling checkout is not
    the version CI tests against** -- it can be ahead, behind, or on a branch -- so a
    green local contract test and a green CI contract test are different claims.

20. **A "not yet" comment is the one claim nothing can check, and it goes stale in
    silence.** `run.py`'s `_apply` executed the display actions and dropped `Mark` and
    `Reward`, saying they "belong to the I/O layer, which has no simulator yet".
    `dio.Simulated` landed five days later and that sentence became false with nothing
    to notice: it is a claim about the *rest of the repository*, and a test suite can
    only check claims about the code under it. The cost was the M1 gate running a
    thousand trials, scoring them correct, strobing no codes and delivering no reward,
    with every test green — and `bounds`' fluid check, the welfare-critical one,
    called by nothing outside its own tests for a week. `scheduler.py` was the same
    shape without the animal: mutation-clean, and `taskd` never imported it, so
    `_index` was never incremented in the module's whole life.

    Three rules, and the first is the one that would have caught it: **a safety
    component ships with its consumer in the same commit, or its absence fails.**
    `run.Unwired` now refuses a mark or a reward it cannot deliver, the way
    `dio.Absent` and `welfare.Absent` refuse. **Test the path, not the piece** — every
    link of that chain was individually tested while the chain was broken. And write
    what a "not yet" is waiting for **by name**, so the next reader can grep it rather
    than believe it. Same family as traps 7 and 18: the question is never whether a
    guardrail passes, it is whether anything reaches it. Now pitfall P21.

21. **A test fixture can satisfy the thing it is meant to violate.** The test that the
    calibration fit uses the *hold* rather than the whole trial put the animal at a
    fixed wrong position first -- and that position sat inside some target's 3° window,
    so on that trial the hold completed from gaze that never moved and the test passed
    for a reason unrelated to the slice under test. Fixed by making the wrong position
    relative to each target. **Watched it fail before trusting it** (`began = 0.0` in
    `Calibrating.observe`), which is what found the fixture bug rather than shipping a
    test that could not fail.

22. **A limit built the wrong way round passes every test it has.** Fluid was modelled
    as a ceiling from M0 until 2026-09-06: `bounds` refused a delivery past a daily
    "budget", `welfare` stopped the session on it, and both were thoroughly tested,
    mutation-clean and internally consistent. **The PI's protocol has no fluid ceiling
    at all** -- only a daily floor, supplemented by hand afterwards -- so all of that
    correctness was in service of withholding fluid an animal had earned.

    Nothing in the repository could have caught it. The tests asserted the model, the
    mutation gate proved the tests could fail, and S8 §4's phrase *"daily fluid
    budget"* is what made the wrong reading available in the first place. What caught
    it was **asking the PI a direct question at the moment the code forced one**
    (CLAUDE.md, "ask, do not file"), on a decision that was animal-facing and expensive
    to get wrong.

    Two durable changes came out of it. `Floor` and `Ceiling` are **different types**,
    because a minimum stored as a maximum reads as a maximum at every call site --
    which is precisely how a floor came to be compared with `>`. And a limit whose
    *direction* is load-bearing now says which it is in its own name: `minima` beside
    `ceilings`, `shortfall` rather than `check_delivery`.
