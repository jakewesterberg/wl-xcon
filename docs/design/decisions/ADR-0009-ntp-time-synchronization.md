# ADR-0009: wl-works runs an NTP server, and lab hosts synchronize to it

- Status: Accepted 2026-09-20
- Date: 2026-09-20
- Deciders: PI

## Context

Welfare marks are now wall-clock times rather than intervals — the out-of-cage departure
mark is a clock time an operator reads and types (PI, 2026-09-20; `welfare.left_cage`
does the mapping onto the session clock itself). And the daily fluid figure spans two
deployments, the rig and the cage-side kiosk, that cannot see each other's records. Both
need to agree on what "today" is and what "09:15" means, and nothing today guarantees
that they do: each host keeps whatever clock it booted with.

> **Superseded in part, 2026-09-26, by P4d-2a spec §10.** `welfare.left_cage` no longer
> maps onto the session clock: every welfare duration is on the wall clock, with the
> departure, the return and the head-fixation marks kept as wall instants. And a session
> reads the host clock once, when it is created, and carries that forward on a steady
> clock (Ruling 8 of that slice), so a synchronization step during a session does not move
> its out-of-cage interval; the host's offset at session creation is what the session
> inherits. *Amended 2026-09-26 by that slice's final review:* the steady clock counts the
> time the host is asleep (`CLOCK_BOOTTIME` on Linux, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on macOS), where
> `time.monotonic()` did not, and it lives in `welfare.py` as `welfare.SessionClock`. The
> decision below is unchanged.

**What was verified, and when:**

- `docs/design/architecture.md` states, unqualified until this commit: wl-works binds
  only to WireGuard and lab machines have no route in, and `wl-preproc` enforces "never
  initiates a connection" with an AST guardrail. Re-checked against `wl-preproc` source
  2026-09-20 (`tests/test_cli_guardrails.py`): the guardrail is a static AST walk over
  **`wl_preproc`'s own package source**, asserting nothing in it opens an outbound
  socket — a property of that application's code, not a network-layer rule. NTP is
  client-initiated by the protocol itself, so a lab host that wants time from wl-works
  needs a route to it (UDP 123) that does not exist today.
- `ntp.kuleuven.be`, KU Leuven ICTS's central NTP service, **exists** — verified
  2026-09-20 directly against ICTS's own service page,
  `https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/services/ntp`: it names `ntp.kuleuven.be`
  (134.58.255.1) as the synchronization source for users within KU Leuven, confirmed
  independently by DNS resolution the same day. ~~Its reachability from the rig's
  specific network segment is **UNVERIFIED** and is a question for the PI or ICTS, not
  settled here.~~ **Closed 2026-09-20: the PI named the server, and it is
  `ntp.wl.works`.** So the ICTS service is checked and not chosen rather than pending,
  and its segment reachability is no longer an open question about anything — the
  verification is kept above because it is why the alternative was worth considering
  at all, and moves to *Alternatives considered* below.
- A second claim considered alongside it — that KU Leuven's Computer Science
  department separately runs `ntp.cs.kuleuven.be` — does **not** hold up under an
  attempt to verify it: queried against public DNS 2026-09-20, that hostname returns
  `NXDOMAIN`. General DNS resolution was confirmed working at the same time (`kuleuven.be`
  and `www.cs.kuleuven.be` both resolve), so this is not a broken resolver. A
  department-internal service could still be resolvable only from inside KU Leuven's
  network (split-horizon DNS would produce exactly this result from outside it), so this
  does not prove the server doesn't exist — but its existence is **UNVERIFIED**, unlike
  `ntp.kuleuven.be`'s, and it is recorded here so a later session does not repeat it as
  settled fact.
- The sync box already carries an NTP-stamped start in one case: `wl-preproc`'s frozen
  `SessionManifest` contract (verified 2026-09-20 against
  `wl_preproc/contracts/manifest.py`) defines `StartedAtSource.SYNCBOX_NTP` — used as the
  session *label* source specifically when there is no task PC (anesthetized mapping,
  spontaneous-activity sessions); that module's own docstring is explicit that "the
  timebase is always the sync box" regardless of which label source is used. Checked the
  same day: `wl-touchtrain`, the cage-side kiosk repository, specifies no sync box and no
  clock source at all yet (no `clock`, `NTP` or `sync` reference anywhere in its docs).

## Decision

**wl-works runs an NTP server at `ntp.wl.works`. Lab hosts synchronize their wall
clocks to it.** The hostname is the PI's, named 2026-09-20, which is what turns this
from a decision about *which system* serves the time into a configuration a host can
actually be pointed at. Today that host is the task PC; the cage-side kiosk joins once
`wl-touchtrain` specifies a platform for it. This is ordinary client-initiated NTP: the
lab host asks, `ntp.wl.works` answers.

**A named hostname does not make the service more authoritative than it is**, and this
is the line in this ADR most likely to be misread once `ntp.wl.works` appears in a
config file. It serves bookkeeping time, as the next paragraph says, and nothing else.

**This serves bookkeeping time only, never experimental time.** Which day it is, which
operator acted, when an animal was marked out of or back into its cage. The timing
record is unaffected and remains the sync box's hardware ticks and the strobed event
words — S3's finding that "our log is not the timing record" still holds, in full, for
the same reason it held before: two other systems already carry the timing of anything
scientifically meaningful. Nobody should read an NTP-disciplined wall clock on a task PC
or a kiosk as good enough for aligning neural data, now or later [@mills2010network;
@karsh2026sync].

**Verify rather than assume.** Preflight should compare the host clock against the
reference and refuse or warn beyond a threshold, in the same spirit as every other check
in this system. That is recorded here as a preflight item **to build**; it is not built
by this ADR.

## Alternatives considered

**`ntp.kuleuven.be` (KU Leuven ICTS's central service). Checked, and not chosen —
settled 2026-09-20 by the PI naming `ntp.wl.works`.** It loses on none of its merits: it
exists (verified against ICTS's own service page, above — the verification is kept
precisely because it is why this was a real alternative rather than a straw one), it is
free, and it is the institution's own answer to this exact problem. It loses because the
PI chose the lab's own server, which is already controlled infrastructure the rig depends
on for other pull-based integration (`docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md`).

**What this closes and what it does not.** Whether `ntp.kuleuven.be` is reachable from
the rig segment was carried here as an open question for the PI or ICTS; it is **no
longer one**, because nothing is going to depend on it. **The route to `ntp.wl.works` is
still open** — see *Consequences* — and the two must not be confused: one question is
closed by not being asked any more, and the other is unanswered.

**The sync box.** It already expects to carry an NTP-stamped start, but only as a
session-label source for sessions with no task PC — it does not, by itself, give either
deployment this decision is actually about (the rig's own wall clock, or the kiosk's) a
synchronized time. The cage-side kiosk has no sync box at all today, and `wl-touchtrain`
has not specified one. A mechanism only one of the two deployments has cannot be what
makes them agree with each other.

## Consequences

**A route that does not exist today has to exist, and it is narrower than it sounds.
Still open, and naming the server did not close it** (2026-09-20): lab hosts need a path
to `ntp.wl.works` on **UDP 123**, and the current topology does not give them one.
`docs/design/architecture.md`'s topology paragraph is amended in this commit: lab
machines still have no route in for the application layer, and `wl-preproc`'s AST
guardrail — a check over application source — is completely untouched by this decision.
What changes is one routing exception, one port, one direction: a lab host may reach
`ntp.wl.works` on UDP 123 to ask the time. Do not read this as the guardrail being relaxed; it
refuses exactly what it always refused, and nothing in `wl_preproc` gains a socket it
did not have.

**A wl-works outage stops clocks being corrected, and that is mild.** An NTP client that
cannot reach its server keeps its own clock and drifts at whatever rate its local
oscillator drifts (ordinary ppm-scale rates, not a number this repository has measured
or needs to). It does not stop, error, or invalidate anything already recorded. A
multi-day wl-works outage does not stop a rig session and does not invalidate a day's
fluid accounting. Nobody should treat wl-works as a session-blocking dependency because
of this decision — it was not one before, and running an NTP service does not make it
one now.

**Scope stays bounded on purpose.** This does not reopen wl-works' welfare-action
exclusion (ADR-0008): NTP is a clock source, not an action, and is never published
through the lab-host protocol. It does not change what the timing record is (S3).

**Follow-ups, not done here:**

- `docs/pending-wl-works-amendments.md` gains a new ask — wl-works runs the service at
  `ntp.wl.works` and opens the routing exception it needs (UDP 123, lab host → wl-works)
  — drafted for that repository's owner to accept, amend or refuse, the same as every
  other ask recorded there. **The hostname is settled and the route is not**, which is
  the whole of what that ask is now about.
- A preflight clock-skew check (compare the host clock to the NTP reference; refuse or
  warn beyond a threshold) is work to build, not built here.
- The session-management design (S8) is where the wall-clock welfare-mark material
  lives, and it is being revised in a concurrent session as of this ADR. Cross-reference
  for whoever next edits it: any discussion of what clock a wall-clock mark (such as the
  out-of-cage departure time) is read against should cite this ADR for where that clock
  comes from and what it does not do.
