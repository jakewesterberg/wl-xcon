# ADR-0004: License for eventual public release

- Status: **Accepted 2026-09-05** — Apache-2.0. Superseded the 2026-08-30 lean toward GPL-3.
- Date: 2026-08-30, decided 2026-09-05

## Context
- PsychoPy is GPL-3: a distributed work importing it must be GPL-compatible; the
  distribution as a whole is effectively GPL-3.
- OpenIris (AGPL-3) and OpenIrisDPI (GPL-3) run as separate processes spoken to over
  a network protocol — no license constraint on our code.
- SpikeGLX SDK: Janelia BSD-3-Clause-style (permissive; redistribution permitted).
- pyzmq (BSD), msgpack (Apache-2.0), NumPy (BSD): permissive.

## Options
(a) GPL-3 for the whole repo — simplest, honest given the PsychoPy import; common in
this niche (pyControl, REC-GUI, Syntalos are GPL). (b) MIT core + isolated GPL
display package — cleaner reuse story, real maintenance cost. (c) Defer engine
coupling via the DisplayAdapter seam and decide at release.

## Current lean (superseded)
(a), unless a concrete reuse scenario needs permissive licensing. Revisit at M7.

## Decision: Apache-2.0

**The lean's own escape clause fired.** It said GPL-3 "unless a concrete reuse
scenario needs permissive licensing", and there is one: **ADR-0007 plans to move
`tasks/` and the event allocation into `wl-exptasks`.** Apache-2.0 code can be taken into
a GPL-3 work but not the reverse, so a GPL-3 core would make that move illegal and
wall this repo off from a stack that is otherwise uniformly Apache-2.0 — `wl-preproc`,
`wl-sync`, `wl-works`, `wl-orchestrator`, `wl-stack`.

**And the premise was false.** The whole case for (a) was "honest given the PsychoPy
import". *There is no PsychoPy import*, and there never has been: not in
`pyproject.toml`, not in the tree, not in 73 commits of history. ADR-0002 is deferred
to V1 and `tools/spike_display.py` exists to ask whether a thin stack can replace
PsychoPy entirely — glfw (zlib) and moderngl (MIT), both permissive. The copyleft
obligation this ADR was reasoning about is not one this project has incurred.

The other constraints in Context are unchanged and none of them forces copyleft:
OpenIris (AGPL-3) and OpenIrisDPI (GPL-3) are separate processes spoken to over UDP,
and every runtime dependency is permissive.

**Apache-2.0 over MIT** for the explicit patent grant, and because it is what the rest
of the family already uses; `wl-sync` is public under it already.

**If ADR-0002 ever chooses PsychoPy**, the adapter that imports it goes in a *separate*
package under GPL-3, behind the `DisplayAdapter` seam that already exists for this
purpose. That is option (b), taken then rather than now, and the seam is what keeps it
cheap. **The core does not become GPL because a display backend did.**

## Consequences
`LICENSE` is Apache-2.0, matching `wl-preproc` byte for byte. The repository is public
as of 2026-09-05. Dependency additions still require a license entry in the inventory
below (CLAUDE.md policy), and an added dependency under a copyleft license is now a
decision that reopens this ADR rather than a routine addition.

**Amended 2026-09-26: OFL fonts may ship as assets** (PI). The browser console (P4d-2b)
bundles IBM Plex Sans, Plex Sans Condensed, Plex Mono and Newsreader, so the page keeps the
wl-works look without reaching the internet. All four are SIL OFL-1.1, verified against
their primary sources on 2026-09-26. OFL-1.1 is copyleft on the font files themselves
(condition 5), which is why this ADR was reopened. It is not copyleft on software that
bundles them (condition 2), so the code stays Apache-2.0. The rule:
- a font under OFL-1.1 may ship **unmodified** as a served asset;
- each font family's `OFL.txt` ships beside its files;
- each font gets a row in the inventory below;
- a modified font, or any other copyleft asset or dependency, still reopens this ADR.

**The copyright holder is Jacob A. Westerberg**, decided 2026-09-05 and applied
across the family in the same pass: `wl-expcontroller`, `wl-preproc`, `wl-sync`,
`wl-stack`, `wl-expviz`, `wl-shook`, `wl-style`, `wl-orchestrator`. Every one shipped
the Apache-2.0 appendix with its placeholder unfilled, so none of them asserted an
owner at all. The year is 2026, which is the first commit year in all ten repositories
that carry a licence.

Two are deliberately not done and are not oversights. **`wl-works`** is owned by
another worker including its remote, so its licence line is theirs to fill.
**`wl-trajectortree`** had eighteen modified files in its working tree; a licence
change does not belong in the middle of someone's uncommitted work.

## Dependency inventory

Maintained per CLAUDE.md's dependency policy: a new dependency needs a one-line
justification and a license entry here.

| Dependency | License | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `pydantic` >= 2 | MIT | Bounded configuration and session-snapshot validation |
| `numpy` >= 1.24 | BSD-3-Clause | Least squares for the gaze calibration fit, and the SVD behind its conditioning gate. The gate is `wl-preproc`'s and is computed with numpy on their side; agreeing with their numerics on a refusal threshold is worth more than saving the dependency. Fitting only -- applying a map in the trial loop is plain float arithmetic (`calibration.EyeMap.degrees`) |
| `pytest` >= 8 (dev) | MIT | Test runner |
| `pyyaml` >= 6 (contract extra) | MIT | Only so `wl-preproc`'s own `eye/xcon.py` (`eye/expcontroller.py` until 2026-09-28) can be imported by the contract tests, which read YAML. Never installed on a rig, and deliberately not `pip install -e ./wl-preproc`, which would pull DataJoint, Kilosort and SpikeInterface |
| `pyzmq` >= 26.4 (console extra) | BSD-3-Clause (pypi.org/pypi/pyzmq/json `.info.license_expression`, verified 2026-09-19) | ADR-0003's control/telemetry transport (ZeroMQ PUB/SUB + REQ/REP), accepted 2026-08-31. Extra, not core: a terminal-only rig needs neither this nor msgpack. **Floor raised from 26 to 26.4 on 2026-09-27** (P4d-2b b2a): the mark signal is read with `Socket.recv_into`, added in 26.4 (pyzmq 27.2.0's `zmq/backend/cython/_zmq.py`, `.. versionadded:: 26.4`, read 2026-09-27). Same package, same license; no new dependency |
| `msgpack` >= 1 (console extra) | Apache-2.0 (pypi.org/pypi/msgpack/json `.info.license_expression`, verified 2026-09-19) | ADR-0003's wire format for control/telemetry messages, accepted 2026-08-31. Same extra as pyzmq; the two ship together |
| IBM Plex Sans (font, bundled unmodified as woff2 in `wl_xcon/fonts/ibm-plex-sans/`) | OFL-1.1, Reserved Font Name "Plex" (`LICENSE.txt` at the root of github.com/IBM/plex and in the release zip, byte-identical, verified 2026-09-26) | The console page's body text in the wl-works typography, served by `wlx serve` so the page never reaches the internet (P4d-2b spec §4.2, PI 2026-09-26). From the `@ibm/plex-sans@1.1.0` release, 400, 500 and 600; never subset or converted, which would make a Modified Version that could not be called Plex |
| IBM Plex Sans Condensed (font, bundled unmodified as woff2 in `wl_xcon/fonts/ibm-plex-sans-condensed/`) | OFL-1.1, Reserved Font Name "Plex" (as IBM Plex Sans, verified 2026-09-26) | The console page's labels and headings. From the `@ibm/plex-sans-condensed@2.0.0` release, 400, 600 and 700; never subset or converted |
| IBM Plex Mono (font, bundled unmodified as woff2 in `wl_xcon/fonts/ibm-plex-mono/`) | OFL-1.1, Reserved Font Name "Plex" (as IBM Plex Sans, verified 2026-09-26) | The console page's numbers and paths. From the `@ibm/plex-mono@2.5.0` release, 400, 500 and 600; never subset or converted |
| Newsreader (font, bundled unmodified as woff2 in `wl_xcon/fonts/newsreader/`) | OFL-1.1 (`OFL.txt` at productiontype/Newsreader `cfcb4f7`, byte-identical to google/fonts `ofl/newsreader/OFL.txt`, verified 2026-09-26) | The wl.works logo's face on the console page: 700 upright and italic, from the 72pt optical-size cut, the size the logo's text is set at |
| `pyjwt[crypto]` >= 2.10.1 (signin extra) | MIT (pypi.org/pypi/pyjwt/json `.info.license_expression`, 2.15.1, verified 2026-10-02) | Verifies a wl.works access token offline on the rig: RS256 against wl.works' published keys, audience, issuer and expiry (P4d-2b b2b spec §5). 2.10.1 is the floor because 2.10.0 compared a string issuer as a substring (read from its wheel, 2026-10-02) |
| `cryptography` (via `pyjwt[crypto]`) | Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause (pypi.org/pypi/cryptography/json `.info.license_expression`, 50.0.2, verified 2026-10-02) | PyJWT's RSA backend; also generates the tests' throwaway keys and certificates |
| `playwright` >= 1.63 (browser extra, tests only) | Apache-2.0 (pypi.org/pypi/playwright/json `.info.license_expression`, 1.63.0, verified 2026-10-02) | Drives the console page's script in headless Chromium (b2b spec §8, XC-186). Never installed on a rig |
| `ash` 0.38.0 (Rust crate; `tools/spike_vulkan/` only, never on a rig) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 (the crate's own `Cargo.toml` in the cargo registry cache, verified 2026-10-07) | Vulkan bindings for spike S (engine spec §10.5), throwaway; the display process's own crates are chosen in build E |
| `naga` 30.0.1 (Rust crate, `wgsl-in`, `spv-out`; `tools/spike_vulkan/offscreen/` only) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 (as `ash`, verified 2026-10-07) | Translates spike S's WGSL compute shader to SPIR-V at start-up. Its 31 transitive crates are all permissive (`docs/measurements/wh-dws0/2026-10-07-vulkan-spike/gpu-out/licenses.txt`) |
