"""Colour pop-out search. The paradigm the vocabulary could not express.

Until 2026-08-31 this task was **unwritable**, twice over. There was no colour, so a
red target among green distractors could not be stated at all; and an array was N
separate `Show` actions, so set size was a change to the *shape* of the task rather
than a value -- a different file for four items and eight, invisible to live editing.
Both are the commonest manipulations in visual search, which is the lab's programme.

What makes this the pop-out paradigm rather than a collection of shapes: the target
and the distractors differ in **exactly one** feature, and which feature is a
parameter. Swapping `target_looks` from a red disc to a square turns a colour
pop-out into a shape pop-out between one trial and the next, with the same task
running and the same structure recorded.

`target_looks` and `distractors` are isoluminant by construction -- `DKL(lum=0)` -- which is a
claim about photometry, so this task **runs only on a measured display calibration that carries
its primaries' spectra** (engine spec §7.3; engine build A2): on the default it is refused in
every kind of session. Its red and green are the PI's 2023 pop-out items' (Westerberg et al.
2023, Methods, "Task design: Pop-out search"), made isoluminant in the lab's observer, as
contrasts about `BACKGROUND`, the gray the array is shown on (spec §7.5; the engine A2 plan's
Q1). No calibration for our panels exists yet.

#: rig's measured screen makes with a small margin. On sRGB-like primaries at an 80 cd/m² white,
#: RED, made mostly by the red primary with a little green beside it, needs that primary at full
#: drive on a 17.7 cd/m² gray, so 16 leaves 9.4% (computed 2026-10-10); re-set when the panels

#: brighter (Weber +1.5).
