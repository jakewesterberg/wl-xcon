"""The calibration block: one target, held, per trial.

**Written in the ordinary task vocabulary on purpose.** S5 §7 calls this a planned
block, and the cheapest way to find out whether the vocabulary can express its own
calibration was to write it there rather than build a special-purpose driver beside
it. It can, and the exercise cost nothing -- which is itself the finding, since the
previous four times a real artifact was written against this vocabulary it exposed a
gap (trap 5).

**The target position is a parameter, so the constellation is the block's schedule
rather than this file's business.** `calibration.constellation` says where the
thirteen targets go; the scheduler walks them one trial each, and an animal that
refuses one simply leaves that condition short. That is why `fit_eye` accepts fewer
targets than were presented and reports what it could reach.

**Nothing here fits anything.** The trial's job is to put a target up, decide whether
the animal really held it, and reward that. Turning held fixations into a map is
`calibration.Collector`'s, and it deliberately consumes only trials this task scored
`CORRECT` -- a fixation the task would not pay for is not one to calibrate against.

**Written for direct view** (`view="direct"`, direct-view spec §8), over its ±15° region.
The stereoscope's constellation, over its ±12° mask, is `calibration.constellation`'s too, and
the task that presents it does not exist yet: it is backlog item XC-005, not yet written.
(`wlx run --view stereoscope` exists since direct view part 2.)
