"""Detection with contrast on a staircase, and mini-blocks of held eccentricity.

The task S1's bake-off expected to be the hard case, and it was not: **the trial is
`fixation_detection`'s trial unchanged.** A staircase was never a within-trial
concern. Everything adaptive here lives in `next_params`, which is ordinary Python
called at a trial boundary, outside the frame budget (ADR-0006).

That is the whole argument for the split, demonstrated rather than asserted: the
strongest case for imperative trials evaporates once condition generation lives
between trials, where it always belonged.
