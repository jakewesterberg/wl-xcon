"""This rig's display settings: what both setups' fields are built from.

The direct-view spec §2: "The rig's settings hold everything the geometry needs: `Z`; the
mask's half-angle; the sensor housings' rectangles." One screen at one place serves both
setups, so one file does too: `Rig.direct()` is the field in direct view, and
`Rig.stereoscope(E)` the field through the stereoscope for a subject whose half-IPD, `E`,
comes from its record.

Python rather than YAML, for the reason the tasks and `reference_bounds.py` are (ADR-0006):
plain text, diffable, and read in an ordinary editor.

**The light sensors' housings are not measured yet** (direct-view spec §9 item 1: "measured
at build from the real sensors"). Until they are, `housings` is empty and `RIG.direct()`
refuses, so no task passes a direct-view check on this rig's settings. That is deliberate: a
field without them would pass a stimulus drawn under a housing, and a guessed rectangle is a
number nobody measured. The tests stand for this rig with stand-in housings they label as
such.

**Sessions are checked against this file** since direct view part 2: `wlx run --rig` and
`wlx check --rig` load it and build the chosen setup's field from it.
