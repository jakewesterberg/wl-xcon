"""Fixation -> detection. The first task intended to run on an animal (roadmap M6).

Fixate, hold, a target appears at one of six positions, saccade to it, hold, reward.

Every number here is a parameter rather than a literal, because S8 §3 makes them
live-editable between trials and the console's widgets are generated from these
declarations. A literal would be invisible to all of that.
