"""Which modules this change needs mutated, and with what flag.

The full sweep re-runs the whole suite once per function -- twenty-nine modules and
566 functions on 2026-09-30 -- and it grows with every module and every test. This
selects the subset a change can actually have affected, so a push pays for what it
touched. **The full sweep still runs nightly** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and
that is not decoration: see "What this can miss", below.

**`--shard K/N` cuts by function, not by module (PI, 2026-09-30).** The selected
modules' functions are one list -- modules by name, each module's functions in
`mutate.py --all`'s own order -- cut into `N` contiguous chunks whose sizes differ by
at most one. Shard `K` runs chunk `K` as one `mutate.py --all --only <its part>` per
module it touches, so a module can be split between two machines. Until then a
module was kept whole and the modules balanced by function count, which left
`serve` (60 functions) alone on one machine for 2h42m of a push's gate (run
36737681413, read 2026-09-30) however many machines there were. See `shard_plan`.

**A new module cannot silently escape the gate.** Every file in `wl_xcon/`
must appear in `RETURNS` or in `EXEMPT` with a reason, and this script fails if one
does not. That is the actual hazard here -- `findings.py` was added earlier today and
was never added to the workflow's hand-maintained module list, so it would have gone
ungated indefinitely without anyone noticing. A list you have to remember to update is
a list that is wrong.

**What this can miss, stated rather than implied.** Mutation coverage is a property of
a module *and* the tests that cover it. Selecting on changed files catches the two
common cases -- the module changed, or its own test file changed -- and misses one:
deleting or weakening a test in `test_a.py` that happened to be the only thing
covering a function in `b.py`. Nothing in a diff makes that visible, so the nightly
full sweep is what catches it. Anything structural (`conftest.py` and the shared
test helpers beside it, `mutate.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `tasks/`) escalates to a full
sweep here rather than being reasoned about, because those change what every test
sees.

    `changed_only=True` is what `--changed-only` passes -- a push or pull request.
    A full sweep is now roughly six hours (2026-09-27; see docs/CHECKPOINT.md's CI
    row), so a push runs only what its own diff can have affected and **never
    escalates at all** (the controller's ruling, 2026-09-27, on the PI's intent:
    "the full check nightly only"); the sharded nightly `--all` sweep covers every
    escalation case instead.

    There are exactly two ways below that this function would otherwise escalate
    to every module -- a GLOBAL path, and a `tasks/` path, since reference tasks
    are inputs to many tests just as a GLOBAL file changes what every test sees --
    and `changed_only` is checked in both, not in one and forgotten in the other.
    Each says, when it would have escalated, that it did not and that the nightly
    sweep covers it, so the log does not read like a full check that happened to
    select nothing. **Not escalating adds nothing; it never removes anything**: the
    modules the change touched directly, and their own test files, are still swept
    beside a shared path (2026-09-28 -- until then a shared path returned an empty
    selection early, so a push touching `conftest.py` and `serve.py` swept neither).
    **If a third escalation path is ever added here, it must get
    the same `if changed_only` treatment**, or `--changed-only` silently stops
    meaning "never escalates" for that one path -- `tests/test_mutation_gate.py`'s
    `test_every_escalation_path_in_select_is_covered_by_changed_only` is what would
    need a new case added alongside the new path.
