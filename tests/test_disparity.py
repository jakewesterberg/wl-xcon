"""Binocular structure that displacing a whole stimulus cannot express.

`Stimulus.disparity` shifts an entire patch, which covers position disparity and
nothing else. Two things the disparity programme cannot do without:

**Anticorrelated RDS.** Dots of opposite contrast in the two eyes. It is the control
every disparity paper is asked for, because V1 responds to it while perceived depth
inverts or vanishes -- so it separates a correlation-based response from a
depth-based one. There is no way to write it as a displacement.

**Disparity-defined form.** A corrugation or a slant is a depth *field* across one
patch, not one number for the patch. It is what 3D-shape work is built on, and it is
also the only way to make a stimulus whose form is invisible monocularly -- Julesz's
whole point, and the reason cyclopean form is a category of its own.
