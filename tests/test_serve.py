"""`wlx serve` (P4d-2b slice b1): the hub, the HTTP surface, and the whole process.

Sim first: the end-to-end test runs a real `wlx run --link` in the simulator and a
real `wlx serve` on loopback, and reads the page's event stream the way a browser
would. Every socket here has a client timeout, so a broken server fails a test in
seconds rather than hanging the suite (and the mutation sweep) for 300.

# /commands the way the page sends them (spec §5.4) ----------------------------------

#: The three framework codes b2a allocates (`tasks/allocation.py`), and the first code
#: `fixation_detection` strobes in a trial.
PAUSE_CODE, RESUME_CODE, MARK_CODE, FIX_ON = 4131, 4132, 4133, 4096
#: `fixation_detection`'s trial-ending markers (`codes._standing_outcomes`).
MARKERS = {34, 35, 36, 37, 38}

#: **Ruling 10, sized for these sessions.** Each one below is ended by the page's
#: `stop`, its schedule or its limit within about a hundred trials: 27 to 84 over three
#: runs of these twelve tests in the plan's pre-flight, 2026-09-27. b1's
#: `E2E_TRIAL_BUDGET` is sized for b1's session, which has no mark socket; a session
#: with one runs fewer trials a second in the simulator, every frame paying for the
#: mark check Task 14 measures. There, b1's 20,000 trials took about 20 s without one,
#: and 1,000 took a few seconds with one (scratch readings on one loaded machine, not
#: claims about this system). Under b1's budget, a mutant that breaks the command path
#: -- `taskd.Session._command` neutered -- held each of these tests past 50 s, its 20 s
#: frame wait and then its 30 s join, and the suite past the mutation harness's 300 s:
#: a timeout, which no test noticed.
#:
#: **400, with each trial paced** (after `main`'s run `36497082927`, 2026-09-29). There,
#: the mark end to end failed once in a restore run, on unmutated code, with "wlx run
#: had ended": the budget ran out before the console showed what the test waited for.
#: (2026-10-01: those words were also all that a `wlx run` killed at startup by the
#: port race `tests/_ports.py` closes left behind, so that failure may have been it.)
#: The simulator runs trials unpaced, a few hundred frames a second, and `wlx serve`'s
#: telemetry thread handles every frame in turn. So a runner slow enough leaves the
#: console's latest frame behind a session producing at nearly the rate the thread can
#: take, and it may not catch up before the budget ends the session. Scratch probes
#: on copies of the tree, 2026-09-29, two runs each of the thirteen end to end tests:
#: - unpaced, with every frame the console takes delayed 20 ms, failed 3 and then 1;
#: - paced at 5 ms, under the same delay, failed none.
#: Each sleep also releases the GIL to the threads a test's commands pass through. The
#: budget comes down with the pacing so that a broken command path still fails these
#: tests in a few seconds. With `taskd.Session._command` mutated, the harness's run
#: took 171 s paced and 155 s unpaced locally, against its 300 s limit.

class _Session:
    """A real simulated `wlx run --link PUB,REP,MARK` on a thread, the `Server` beside

    frame the session published, the card the session strobed onto (captured as `wlx
    run` builds it), and the record.

    **Every frame, on this test's own SUB socket** (the b2a final fix wave). The
    console holds only the latest frame, so a state that lasts one frame -- a setting
    staged at one boundary and applied at the next -- can come and go between two
    looks. On CI's two-vCPU runners it did, with the simulated rig competing for the
    GIL (runs `36453778281` and `36435219146`). `recorder` connects before `wlx run`
    binds, **but a SUB receives only what is published after its subscription has
    joined**, which happens some time after the bind, on libzmq's reconnect timer. So
    a test reading `frames` first waits with `seen` for any frame, which proves the
    subscription is live, before it sends anything. From then on libzmq queues what
    arrives on its own I/O thread, with no GIL, up to the socket's high-water mark:
    1,000 messages, pyzmq 27.2.0 and libzmq 4.3.5's default as read in this venv on
    2026-09-28. A session here publishes one frame per boundary. Only `seen` reads
    `recorder`, so a test that uses it does its waiting on the console with `frame`
    and reads the recorder afterwards; what it reads is bounded by how few trials the
    session runs before the test stops it."""
