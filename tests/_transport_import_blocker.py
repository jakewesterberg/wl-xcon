"""Run in a fresh subprocess by `test_no_transport_leak.py` -- never imported in
this process, and never collected by pytest itself (its name does not match
`test_*.py`).

**Why a subprocess at all.** Once `zmq` or `msgpack` has been imported anywhere in a
process, `sys.modules` caches it, and every later `import zmq` returns the cached
module without ever consulting `sys.meta_path` again. By the time this repository's
test suite reaches any single test, `tests/test_link.py` has almost certainly already
imported real `zmq`/`msgpack` (its `ZmqLink`/`ZmqConsole` tests need them), so a
blocker installed in that same process would protect nothing. Only a fresh
interpreter, with the blocker installed before either name is first imported, proves
the property this file exists to prove: that `wl_xcon.link`,
`wl_xcon.taskd`, and (since Task 6's fix round 1 added the module-level
`from wl_xcon import link as _link` that `wlx console`/`wlx run --link` use)
`wl_xcon.cli` do not require a transport dependency to import.

**Why `find_spec`, never `find_module`.** Task 1 of this slice originally shipped a
verification using a `sys.meta_path` finder that defined only `find_module`. Task 1's
own fix round found that hook silently inert on this interpreter (Python 3.13.9):
`importlib`'s finder protocol no longer falls back to the legacy hook, so a
`find_module`-only finder is skipped outright and a real `import zmq` sails straight
through it while the check goes on to report success -- a check that cannot fail,
which is exactly what `CLAUDE.md`'s `tools/mutate.py` rule exists to catch, just
written by hand instead of as a pytest test. This script uses `find_spec`, and proves
the block can fail (`import zmq` and `import msgpack` must each raise) before it
trusts anything the block appears to protect.
