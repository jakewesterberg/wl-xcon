"""A complete `Telemetry` frame, at this build's `SCHEMA`, for the browser console's
tests (P4d-2b b1; schema 8's fields since b2a, schema 9's since direct view part 2, schema 10's since b3a,
schema 12's since session levels, schema 13's since XC-026, schema 15's `session_kind`,
`calibration` and `warnings` since engine build B).

Imported by `test_health.py`, `test_web.py` and `test_serve.py` as
`from _frames import frame`; never collected, because its name does not start with
`test_`. Every field holds a value a test can find in rendered output, and every
field that may be `None` holds a number here, so a test that wants an absence asks
for it by name -- **except schema 8's `paused_at` and `scheduled_stop`**, whose
`None` is the ordinary running session (not paused, nothing scheduled), and whose
number would make every frame here a paused one. Schema 9's `half_ipd_cm` is `None` for
the same kind of reason: the frame is a direct-view session, which has none. Schema 10's `preflight` and
`question` are `None` for the ordinary frame, like `paused_at`. Schema 12's `performance` is
a running session's four levels, each level's counts distinct from every other's, and
`returned_at` is `None`, like `paused_at`: a running session's animal has not gone back.
Schema 13's `resumed_at` is `None` too: a session opened in this process, never resumed.
