"""`taskd` — running a session end to end.

Roadmap M1's gate: a complete task, headless, deterministic over 1,000 trials, with
the full record on disk. Everything below runs against simulators, and the seam it
runs against is the same one hardware will plug into (S6 §6).

**P4b added the session around the trial loop**: blocks with criterion transitions,
the clocks, the one ceiling that ends a session, one validated path for live
parameter writes, and the reward path that reaches `bounds` -- which for a week
reached nothing at all. Several tests below exist to keep a session from being able
to run without those, which is a different claim from their being present.

**That ceiling is time out of the cage** (PI, 2026-09-19), and it is the only one.
This said "a restraint clock, ceilings that end a session", which was two errors in
one clause by the time it was read: chair time is recorded and bounds nothing, and
there is no trial cap at all.

    `link` defaults to `None`, i.e. omitted from the call -- `Session.link` then
    falls back to its own default, `link.Absent()`, exactly as a session with no
    console attached does outside a test.

    **Its wall clock advances with its simulated frames**: `WALL_NOW` plus
    `session.now()`. Every welfare duration is read on the wall since P4d-2a (spec
    §10), so a session whose wall stood still would never reach its out-of-cage
    ceiling -- and that ceiling is both what several tests below are about and the
    backstop that ends a broken scheduler's session on simulated seconds rather than
    at a 300-second mutation timeout (`_bounds`). A wall that follows the frames is
    what a rig has anyway, where frames are real time. Tests about the two clocks
    *disagreeing* inject a wall of their own (`_Wall`).

    **The marks this deployment kind needs** (`welfare.preflight`): the out-of-cage
    one starts the clock that bounds the session, and head-fixation is the restraint

    `left_cage_ago` stays expressed as an interval because that is what a test about
    the *interval* means; it is turned into a clock time against `WALL_NOW` here,
    which is the one place a test has to know that the parameter changed base. It
    defaults to zero, which is the truth for a simulated session -- nothing was
