"""Fluid and duration accounting, and the only path to the pump.

S8 §5 and §7. **Welfare-critical, and requires human review before merge**
(CLAUDE.md).

**Fluid has a floor, not a ceiling** (PI, 2026-09-06). A session never refuses a
delivery on volume; it reports at close how much of the day's minimum is still owed,
so a person can supplement it.

**One duration limit, and it is out-of-cage to back-in-cage** (PI, 2026-09-19).
There is no session-length maximum and no trial cap; chair time is recorded and
bounds nothing. Several tests below are about *which clock is measured* rather than
about arithmetic, because the two clocks differ by transport and chairing and the
wrong one under-counts.

The reason this module exists at all is that `bounds`' fluid check was called by
nothing outside its own tests for a week. A bound nothing calls reads as present and
is not, so these tests are as much about *who calls whom* as about arithmetic.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every number that enters the welfare path, and the proof that this is all of
# them
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# **Three Criticals in three review rounds were one class of defect, found one
# surface at a time**: a guard on a *limit* while the *measurement* compared
# against it went unchecked. `nan` defeats every ordered comparison by being
# `False` against all of them, `inf` by being unreachable, and a negative
# magnitude by passing a `>` that expects a quantity. Fixing each surface where it
# was found is why there were three rounds.
#
# So the surface is enumerated rather than sampled, and the enumeration is
# **checked by code rather than asserted**. `ENTRY_POINTS` names every way a
# number reaches `welfare` or `bounds` from outside the process;
# `test_the_enumeration_of_numeric_entry_points_is_complete` recomputes that set
# from the live modules and fails if anything is in neither list. Adding a
# float-taking method to either welfare-critical file therefore fails this suite
# until it is guarded and listed, or listed as exempt with a reason -- the same
# shape as `tools/mutation_gate.py`, which refuses to run when a module is in
# neither of its lists.
#
# **What would have to be true for a door to be missing**, stated so the claim is
# falsifiable rather than confident. A number would have to reach a comparison in
# `bounds` or `welfare` without passing any parameter or field this enumeration can
# see. **There are at least six such routes** -- an earlier version of this comment
# said "exactly two", which a review disproved by planting six doors it could not
# see, three of them in the first category alone:
#
# 1. **A parameter or field the introspection cannot classify** -- unannotated, or
#    annotated `object`/`Any`, or behind a `@property`/`@staticmethod`/`@classmethod`
#    descriptor rather than a plain function. Closed:
#    `test_every_numeric_parameter_is_annotated` refuses the first two, and
#    `_callables` walks the third.
# 2. **A numeric annotation the classifier does not recognise.** `int | None`,
#    `Optional[int]` and `Decimal` all slipped the first version. Narrowed, not
#    closed: `_NUMERIC` is a word-boundary regex over a list of spellings, and a
#    type it does not name is invisible. Adding one means adding it there.
# 3. **A number inside a container.** `Bounds.ceilings`/`minima` are `dict`, and the
#    numbers in them are guarded by `Ceiling`/`Floor` -- the types inside the
#    container, not the container's annotation. A `dict[str, float]` field would be
#    a real hole, and there is none in either file.
# 4. **`*args`/`**kwargs`**, which name no parameter to enumerate. Only `Pump`'s
#    Protocol has them, and it takes no welfare quantity.
# 5. **Arithmetic**: two checked values producing an unchecked third. Not closable by
#    enumerating doors, which is why `out_of_cage_seconds` checks the *computed*
#    duration and `reconcile_report` checks both of its inputs.
# 6. **Assignment after construction**, which bypasses `__post_init__`. What makes
#    that safe is not the setter but the read: every field feeding a comparison is
#    guarded where it is *used* as well as where it is set.
#
# So the enumeration is complete for *doors it can classify*, and 2–6 are covered by
# checking results as well as inputs. That is the honest boundary.
