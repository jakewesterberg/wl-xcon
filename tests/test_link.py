    Not a real `Session`: constructing one loads a task file and an allocation from
    disk, which these tests have no reason to do. `Telemetry.of`'s parameters are
    untyped precisely so any object with the right shape counts as a session (see
    `link.py`). `.staged` and `.refusals` are supplied directly as plain tuples --
    stand-ins for the real `Session.staged` property and `Session.refusals` field,
    so this fixture does not need to construct either the live-parameter or the
    console-command machinery to satisfy `Telemetry.of`'s shape.

    **`.link` is a real `Absent()`, not omitted.** It used to be absent here and
    `Telemetry.of` reached it through `getattr(session, "link", None)` -- a default
    that existed only to keep this stand-in working, and that would also have
    swallowed a `Session` genuinely built without a link, and (through the second
    `getattr` beside it) a rename of `ZmqLink.refused`. Both defaults are gone; a
    session with no link is an `AttributeError` now, which is why this line is here
    rather than in `Telemetry.of`. `Absent` is what `taskd.Session` itself defaults
    to, so this is the real object and not a further stand-in.

    `delivered_ml` becomes `welfare.delivered` -- the sync box's delivered-line
    figure -- rather than `welfare.commanded`, with `commanded` pinned to a small
    fixed value distinct from it. **This distinction is load-bearing.** Once
    `.delivered` is set, `session_total()` reconciles to `max(commanded, delivered)`
    (`bounds.reconcile`), so with `commanded` small and `delivered` the larger figure
    -- never the reverse, which `reconcile_report` treats as a pump fault rather than
    a smaller total -- `session_total()` lands on `delivered_ml`, distinct from
    `commanded`. Set `commanded=delivered_ml` instead (an earlier version of this
    fixture did, and left `.delivered` at its default `None`) and `session_total()`
    returns exactly `commanded` -- indistinguishable from a `Telemetry.of` that read
    `welfare.commanded` directly instead of calling `.session_total()`, which is the
    one bug S9a §9 exists to catch.

# **What each test holds, and why it cannot change the outcome.** It holds the
# context strongly, and the sockets only through `weakref`s. A context refers to its
# sockets only through its own `WeakSet`, so holding it keeps no socket reachable.
# A strong reference to a socket would keep it in that `WeakSet`, and the old
# `destroy` would then have closed it, so that kind of reference would hide the bug.
# `ctx.closed` stands for the sockets: libzmq's `zmq_ctx_term` returns only once every
# socket in the context is closed, and pyzmq sets `closed` only after it returns. The
# `weakref`s then show that the net let go of the sockets once it ran, and did not
