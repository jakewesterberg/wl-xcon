"""The core must never acquire a transport dependency (`wl_xcon/link.py`'s
own docstring; CLAUDE.md's core/display split; S9a §5's argument, which holds
identically for the console). A rig operator running `wlx run` from a terminal needs
neither `zmq` nor `msgpack`, and this repository keeps a Python 3.13 CI leg that
installs only the core specifically so that a transport dependency leaking into
`taskd.py`, `link.py`, or (Task 6's fix round 1 added this: `cli.py` now imports
`link` by name at module level for `wlx console`/`wlx run --link`) `cli.py` fails
that leg loudly.

`link.py` is the first module in this repository to `import zmq` (Task 5 of the
console-link slice); this is its permanent regression test, not a one-off
verification that lives only in a session's scratchpad and a report. Task 1 shipped
exactly such a one-off, and Task 1's own fix round found it had been proving nothing
-- see `_transport_import_blocker.py`'s module docstring for the full story. That
script is re-run here, by every future test run, rather than trusted once and
forgotten.
