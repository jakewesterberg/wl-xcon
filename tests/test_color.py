"""Colour, in a space the display cannot silently reinterpret.

RGB is a set of instructions to a particular monitor, not a description of a light,
so "red" in a task file means a different stimulus on every panel and nothing at all
in a methods section. The flagship pop-out paradigm -- a red target among green
distractors, isoluminant -- was unwritable in this vocabulary until now, and
*isoluminant* is the word that makes a measurement mandatory: it is a claim about
photometry, and a claim nobody measured is a claim that is usually false.
