The checks existed only inside tests until this existed. A guardrail nobody can run

    """The wiring this task exists for (CLAUDE.md: "a safety component ships with
    its consumer, or its absence fails"). `test_link.py` already proves
    `ZmqLink`/`ZmqConsole` talk to each other directly; nothing before this test
    proved that `wlx run --link` -- through `main()`'s own argument parsing --
    actually attaches a real `ZmqLink` to a running `Session`, or that a console's
    write travels all the way to `parameter_changes.jsonl`.

    **`zmq_cleanup` (now in `conftest.py`, moved there in fix round 1) registers
    `console` below** (and registered a port probe, until 2026-10-01). Fix round 1 found this test reintroduced the 300 s
    mutation hang `test_link.py`'s own `zmq_cleanup` exists to prevent -- that
    fixture was module-local, so this file's sockets were not protected by it. See
    `conftest.py`'s copy for the full mechanism. `main()`'s *own* `ZmqLink`, built
    and closed entirely inside the background thread below, has no handle this test
    could register the same way. This test used to force its collection with a
    `gc.collect()` after the thread joined, on the strength of Task 5's measurement
    that an explicit `gc.collect()` in a bare script was safe. It is not: the link sits
    in a reference cycle through its `Session`, and a collection of that cycle is
    exactly where `link.close`'s mutant deadlocked (2026-09-27). The autouse
    `_every_zmq_context_released` (`tests/_zmq_release.py`) destroys its context at
    teardown instead, without the collector and without `close()`.

    Runs `wlx run` on a background thread (a real `Session.run()`, not a mock) and
    drives a real `ZmqConsole` from the test's own thread -- the same two-sided
    shape as the manual two-terminal drive this task's brief calls for, just
    in-process. Endpoints come from `tests/_ports.py`: free ports below the range the
    operating system assigns from, claimed for this process. They used to come from a
    throwaway `ZmqLink` bound to port 0 and closed at once, a port Linux could hand to
    another socket before `wlx run` bound it again (2026-10-01).

    **Confirms staged-then-applied via telemetry, and only via telemetry.** A
    first draft of this test sent `SetParameter` and read back a single frame just
    to prove the socket was live, trusting a small `--trials` count to end the
    session soon after. That is not safe: `Session.run()` only applies a staged
    change at the *next* pass's top (`_apply_staged()` runs before that pass's own
    `drain()`, `taskd.py`), and if `drain()` happens to pick up the `SetParameter`
    on the session's *literal last* pass -- indistinguishable from any other pass
    to the console, and not improbable when trials are this fast -- the natural
    "every block is finished" stop fires in that same pass, after staging but
    before any later `_apply_staged()` could apply it, and the record never sees
    it. Measured, not theorised: the first draft failed 5/5 runs in isolation
    (`parameter_changes.jsonl` never created) while passing when run after other
    tests in this file had already warmed the same import path -- two timings of
    the same race, not a flake to retry away.

    Fixed two ways, not one: **(a)** wait for a frame that shows `fix_hold` in
    `.staged` and *then* a later frame where it is gone -- proof `_apply_staged()`
    actually ran a pass after staging it, which is what the record depends on --
    rather than trusting that any frame arriving means the write landed; **(b)** the
    session must still be running when the console acts, so the last pass has
    nowhere near enough room to coincide with this command by chance.

    **(b) was a margin, and the margin moved without anyone touching this test**
    (2026-09-26). It was `tasks/reference_bounds.py`'s chair-time ceiling, measured
    at "roughly 1,500" trials. The 2026-09-19 rulings replaced that ceiling with a
    600 s out-of-cage placeholder, and `_hhmm()` starts each run 0-59 s into it, so
    the session ended after about 300 trials and about 0.3 s of wall time -- figures
    from this machine and a scratchpad probe, **not committed under
    `docs/measurements/`, and not a claim about this system**. Started nine minutes
    into that budget, this test failed 5 of 5 on a receive timeout: the session was
    over before the console heard it.

    So the session's length is no longer anybody's ceiling. `_far_bounds` puts the
    out-of-cage limit eight hours away, and **the console ends the session itself**
    with a `Stop` once it has seen the change applied -- which also drives a
    console's `Stop` through a real `wlx run`, the one path the `--stop` tests stub.
    `--trials` now only bounds how long a *broken* run takes to finish on its own.

    **This run ends with no terminal, and never reaches `await_return`** (P4d-2a
    spec §10, Task 8). It used to wait for an `awaiting_return` frame and send the
    console a `ReturnedToCage` to close it -- the PI ruled the wl-works ELN owns the
    return, not a console, so `link.py` carries no such command any more, and
    `wlx run` with no terminal attached (this test's own process, under pytest)
    never starts the post-loop phase at all: `cli._close_interval` records
    `return not recorded (no terminal)` and returns as soon as the stop frame is
    seen. This test keeps its actual point -- a real console attaches, and a real
    write reaches the record -- and stops there.

def _telemetry(**overrides) -> Telemetry:
    """A minimal telemetry frame for renderer tests.

    `fluid_today_ml`/`shortfall_ml` default to `None` -- the unknown-day case --
    so a test that does not override them still exercises the `UNKNOWN` path
    rather than a coincidentally-zero one. Everything else defaults to empty so a
    test that cares about one pane can override just that field without the
    rendered text growing content nobody asked it to check.

    `out_of_cage_seconds` defaults to a *number* rather than to `None`, unlike the
    two above, because its `None` is the rarer case: it means a cage-side session
    with no duration bound at all, and a default of `None` would make every
    renderer test here quietly exercise a kiosk. `chair_seconds` defaults to a
    number for the same reason, and `deployment` to the kind that has one.
    `in_session_seconds` defaults to a number too, for the same reason -- its
    `None` means a frame from before `open()`, which a live console never shows.

    `duration_warning` defaults to `None` -- the quiet case -- so a test that does
    not ask for the warning does not get a line it never checked.

    Schema 7's fields (P4d-2b b1) default to a configured rig session with nothing
    rewarded and no outcome yet: `last_reward_at` is `None` and `recent_outcomes`
    empty, so a test that does not ask for either sees their *none yet* lines.

    Schema 8's (P4d-2b b2a) default to a running session that is not paused, has
    nothing scheduled and no control yet -- the quiet case, as above. Schema 15's
    `warnings` are empty -- nothing accepted -- for the same reason.

    `schema=SCHEMA`, not a stale literal (fix round 1, I3): `decode` now refuses any
    other value before touching a single other field (`link.SchemaMismatch`), and
    `test_console_renders_a_refusal_that_actually_crossed_the_wire` below sends this
    fixture through a real `encode`/`decode` round trip. `render` itself never reads

    `return not recorded` row and a clean 130. The wait now runs inside the `try`,

    `head_released` blocks on it before doing anything, so `phase` provably cannot
    leave `"running"` until the gate opens, and the gate only opens from inside the
    `join(0.01)` patch below -- so the wait loop's first check is guaranteed to find
