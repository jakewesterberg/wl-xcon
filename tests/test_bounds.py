"""The bounded config: what a task cannot express and a console cannot exceed.

S8 §4 and §7. This is welfare-critical code and requires human review before merge
(CLAUDE.md). It is deliberately small.

**Fluid has a floor, not a ceiling** (PI, 2026-09-06). Everything else here is a
ceiling; the daily fluid figure is a *minimum the animal must reach*, topped up by
hand after the session if the work did not earn it. The tests below that used to
assert a refusal past a daily total are gone, and their absence is the point: a
delivery refused on volume withholds fluid an animal earned, which is the opposite of
what the daily figure protects.
